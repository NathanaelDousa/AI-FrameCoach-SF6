hello Grapplers and welcome to a new video it's time to talk about the dos and don'ts of sangi now this video started as a you know game plan but after writing yeah I I wrote something yeah I happened right here I decided to make this as a do and don'ts plus a little bit of a guide so if you're new to S this might be the best video to start with let's check out the buttons first the standing light punch is a really good button it has only a little less range than sing Light kick so you can technically use it for we punishing however the best use is definitely as a stop sign when people try to throw Dash forwards or do something like that you can stop them with this button also you recover in time for o the larat or larat in some instances now we have standing L this is mostly your goto with Punisher I don't particularly like the amount of damage you do for the amount of meter you have to waste this is still the pretty much the best with Punisher you have you're likely going to get counter a counter or punish counter either case like if you're throwing buttons and you use standing Li kick this will be your combo most of the time you have to get used to that standing Li kick due to range and also to speed will with punish most of the buttons in the game if you position yourself correctly crouching light punch is probably the best light overall it doesn't have the range of a standing light Punch or standing light kick nor the speed of crouching light kick but overall it leaves you plus one little push back so you can do stuff like for example this into a button or just just one even though this is not a frame trap you can do one into spine Buster so it is really good after dve rush you're plus five if you hit someone with it and you're dry rushing that is+ 10 and if that's a punish cter that is plus 14 you do get a bunch of frames just by doing this alone it's a great button good range you can definitely bother people with it if you want to use a light and you want to abuse only one single light crouching light punch is it great button overall recovers even faster than sunning light punch also being one frame faster so it has almost everything you want for a really good light and finally clou you like it this is only a defensive poke very hard to use in other scenarios you can however go for something like a dry Rush Crouch you like it but overall this button is only to stop certain pokes and to stop certain pressures you are not going to use this button that much poke once don't try to do this too often cuz sometimes you whiff your Crouch of light punch even your standing light punch can whff so get used to just hitting people once and then do something like SPD or microw walk so on so on but it's just a defensive poke the medium punches everyone's favorites Runing medium punch is definitely the best one it's a good Dy Rush tool your plus two so you can enforce some frame traps or situations it has good range it recovers relatively fast compared to the rest of the mediums you have a lot of range with this thing you can space yourself after a few lights into an medium punch to space trap your opponent we're going to talk about about space traps in a few it is overall a great button it has a Target combo that is guaranteed if you hit someone with a Dy rush or punish counter or counter hit around 2,000 damage for just a Target combo they increased in season two the range of the target combo so it is easier to hit overall it's a great great great button you do have to get used to it it's going to be your main tool I have to say medium punch and Hell staff share more or less the same the same idea these two are mostly combo starters or combo fillers it is very difficult to use them in other scenarios especially now that other buttons have been buffed but they still can get you some really interesting things for example crouching medium punch on counter hit a headbutt that's a combo on punish counter you get a standing heavy punch do you get used to wh punishing with this button you can get good damage and closer to the opponent which is great in the case of Hell stab the the Heat box is so incredibly disjointed you can wh punish some things with this thing for example after poking specifically after one poke I have to say but if you get this it is especially on hit it is very difficult for the opponent to do something about it they cannot jump they canot backd is a really really good tool however uh most of the time you're going to use them as combo fers either for something like this or crouching medium punch into crouching medium punch hell stab that's mainly the use of those two buttons but you can definitely create some situations with them crouching medium kick is a really really good poke again same with the rest of the mediums in even stump it is incredibly disjointed so you can punish some things very easily with this thing the problem is the frames it is a nine framer recovers in 18 frames so one weakness you're going to see for every single medium maybe with the exception of crouching medium punch and stump they're very weak to the ice and random jumps also back dashes so you have to be careful about your mediums crouching medium kick it is still a pretty pretty pretty decent button you can get some things out of it and with the Buffs to season two you can get a driver or punish cter Plus which means this is a combo so you can get that into larat or the larat and do serious damage you're going also get that from other situations like this one or health tab that combos too so it is a better combo filler so you can definitely use it for example if you're wave punishing from over here and you get for example like a crouchy medium Punch or a headbutt it is probably the best tool you can use to just complete your combo because sometimes you can fall short of range with crouching medium punch H low so people have to block it crouching which is also nice so if you if they just want to walk away from s after a certain group of pokes like this or this one try to go for crouchy medium kick in case they do so knee is a complicated button overall it has been buffed you're going to be minus three most of the time but that is the issue it is hard to recognize when you're plus zero or minus sometimes you can be minus three you can get a plus three after Dy Rush your close you're going to get a plus one but if you space it you're going to get more you can even get a plus eight on block it is a very complicated move to really tell people to go for it you have to use it that's the thing you have to use it cuz it has low Crush so it goes over lows however when you do that you get a punish counter so you're going to be plus five most of the time you're going to be plus five that means your combo is going to be really short like crouching light K into sing Light punch larat at best or if you're if you really t it properly especially after oky situations you can get a plus seven to plus eight so the combo is heal up basically it's hard to recognize it is not that an easy tool to use cuz sometimes you don't space yourself properly so people can get aou medium kick standy heavy kick Etc is also very easy to di ey unless you really space it properly hit with the later frames as much as I don't generally like this option you have to go for it so get used to getting into a space where you can go for KNE specifically against a few folks on block get used to something like this so you always get the KNE don't use it up close don't do something like this that is way too risky you have better options but if you know how to space yourself and the opponent is not back dashing that is also very significant go for a couple of FKS on block and then the KNE just be careful it's not a as fast tool nor it is that strong as people say it is I'm talking about other moves that people say they are strong standing medium kick objectively this move lost range I mean it's a fact it lost range it is still the longest medium attack s has the animation doesn't reflect it that much but it is kind of difficult to whip point it in certain scenarios cuz your herb rets he doesn't have the biggest low herb so you can go over low sometimes you take more or less like 75% of one drive gauge you do more damage other mediums like this is 700 700 700 this is 900 so you do get more damage the issue is getting used to situations where you have to rely on this since the range Nerf is now harder to hit someone with the standing minion kick this could lead into situations where you whiff it and if the opponent knows you're whiffing it even though it's is hard to punish they can go for a sweep a dry rush cuz you recover in 19 frames so even though the the actual her her box is really good for S they can definitely get used to dry rushing basically you have to take the pressure if they're in the corner you can certainly go for a few more standing medium kicks than in the neutral but you do have to be careful with this button if if they're close to burnout I would say couple of these could really help you to achieve the burnout otherwise be extremely careful it it's a super slow move and it recovers also as it should cuz it's a Long Poke so it makes sense to recover close to 20 frames it can beat certain lows spaced it is still decent in some situations but don't abuse it and finally even though I I didn't write this I forgot I totally forgot about stump well what can I say about this move it is pretty freaking slow at nine frames so that makes it extremely difficult to combo into you're not going to be in a Range where you can use it sadly this button is still awful even though with the buff to the second attack so you can cancel it into certain things imagine you cannot cancel super level two from the second hit spend it to you know get some frames and have perfect Mees but otherwise I don't think this button has any meaning for S it is still something where Capcom needs to take a look and actually fix this thing it just doesn't work now we can go into Heavies a standing heavy punch oh baby one of my favorite buttons Long Poke save you can increase the range with dry rush and that is plus one without charging it in fact one thing I have to say don't charge it that often I think this button is really good just by pressing it or holding it for a few frames people are getting used to perfect bar this thing as you can see it takes a significant amount of Drive since it is a heavy attack slower it has more range than sing medium if you're not sure what button to use and you're far from the opponent usually standing heavy but will connect the range is very very very insane even though it is 16 frames that is more or less enough to punish certain mediums and Heavies don't be scared to go for it if the opponent is withing either they're going to have to block it or you're going to get a punish cter crou Ching heavy kick this is just very specific it is a wave Punisher Don't go for it as I've seen people go like a couple of bugs and they go for the sweep even though you can space it this is so easy to just back dash your jump such a hell merry sweep so don't don't abuse it like that use it as you should which is a wave Punisher is pretty fast 12 frames faster than other buttons like faster than head for example almost all the time you're going to be able to wave punish with sweep and that is a guaranteed punish counter obviously if you wave punish with it that allows you to go into a very difficult safe jump but you can do it a standing heavy Kake is just an antier very situational antier in the corner punish C and that's it I do have to say thanks to Glick you can actually get since this force is standing on counter hit if you really know how to position yourself with hell stab you can go into this and that's is a legit combo so that doesn't so that is one use you can get out of stab into standing heavy kick however if this if the hell stab is a punish cter you do get a headbutt so as a w punish is kind of dubious if it's better to do this rather than this but at least you have one use for it it is mainly a punish counter tool Corner antier into o b Dynamite couching heavy punch another Niche antier it is very difficult to use as antier as a whip Punisher it's also pretty difficult against certain sweeps in the game is pretty good and if you're perfect pairing a special or a medium certainly will have enough time to go for couching heav punch into dry brush knee hell stab larat which is the usual combo good Corner carry otherwise I don't think this button has any meaning in the corner you can get some really good combos with little little meter but that's it it's very situational jot does everything this is the move you want to use most of the time when you're close even though it's 14 frames the amount of pressure you get is insane if you're close with this plus four you can get a grab you can mash it by the way you can mash the grab and you're going to get it on block on hit is plus seven so now it allows you to go into hell stab immediately recommend getting extremely comfortable with the timing cuz for some reason you can whiff it sometimes be careful it happens to me even though I've been playing s for a while get used to the timing it is it is a fantastic move if you're spaced you might not be able to go into regular throws but you can use SPD is it is plus four so you can use SPD light SPD medium heavy OD depending on the Range depending also on the range of headbutt if you hit someone with a second third active frame you can get a plus six instead of a A plus four here you have even more frames you can frame trap with crouching medium punch it's just a fantastic tool it's Matana Drop Kick the grounded drop kick also a punish counter tool in the corner you can go over certain Fireballs like jury that's it there's not much to say extremely punishable you can go over lows obviously since you can go over Yuri but that's it it's not a good tool also the air drop kick this is mostly for fake stuff you're not going to get many things from this and also for certain punishes you do get a bunch of damage however with the Buffs to headbutt I would argue it's just better to go for driver's headbutt than to try to do something like this if you're really close to the middle of the screen when you hit someone with the punish cter CH drop kick they will bounce in a way where you cannot follow up be careful with this move it's it's not great use it for certain fake stuff like that one or just Dash or back dash even cuz you cannot jump you can use buttons but you cannot jump so if you do it and hold up sang doesn't jump immediately so be careful about that you can back dash forward Dash Barry everything that is motion based except for jumping you can do it wheel kick veryy to space now you can still get hit out of the start of a wheel kick so if you go for a whe kick up close they can Mash a crouching medium kick and they will punish you or crouching medium punch so be careful it's like it's not a fantastic move but it is a somewhat safe overhead you can space it after SPD for example specifically light SPD burnout this becomes really really annoying to to punish cuz you're going to be minus three minus 4 if you sp it correctly or you can Dy rush it and be minus one is super super Anno annoying for the opponent cuz there you can go for super level three like a very cheeky one otherwise this move has some Niche uses like against Blanca or Honda they're in the air because technically the first few frames are an ready for whe kick be careful with this move it's just it's 22 frames oh before I forget punish cter it in the corner it deals a really high amount of damage as a punish cter in the middle of the screen is debatable if you want to use it cuz sometimes you can whiff it for sure you can go for it punish cter especially if you're close punishing shukin or supers just be careful CU it is 22 frames so not all supers can be punished by this thing and some shukin some reversals like um jack knife can go over the wheel kick for some reason so be careful recommendations is just to take a step back and then go for it if you're punishing supers or reversals just in cas is the air headbut is the final heavy it is a very interesting move it has a an extremely fantastic hitbox but the range is awful in the corner you can use it for jumps if you feel they're going to however you have to set it up if you go for a slow move like this and then you try to use it you're going to get hit in the air so you have to jump before thus if you want to set up the jumping headbutt Press buttons or just poke with lights specifically the crouching light punch so you can have enough time to react should they jump you can go into regular B now or OD B I would suggest going for regular B unless you have enough meter to spend even though for some reason I totally forgot about the air normals we're going to check the air normals I don't think things have changed for the jumping normals so the only thing I can add is medium punch does have more range than jumping heavy kick that's why so many s players are doing something like this where the plus frames are interesting we're going to get a plus eight to plus eight compared to that one and on hit sometimes you can get + 12 but it's not all the time compared to heavy kick where you get a consistent plus 12 if you get a little bit deeper you can get the plus 15 for the headbutt if you hit someone with jumping Force medium punch in the air the jumping medium punch you're likely going to get immediately into hell stab oh I'd say your best jumping is still medium kick this one does almost everything you want but if you're really far like over here I suggest try and do something like that cuz it certainly Works especially against Fireballs don't be shy to use jumping medium punch it is actually pretty decent just be careful cuz you have to hit very deep to the jump for example here see so hit it very late into the jump if you really want to use it that doesn't happen with medium K where you can be like you can M time your jump and still get it well that doesn't happen with jumping medium punch for Combos and safe jumps usually jumping heavy punch is the one you want to use also this this one is the easier to go into headbut so still I'd say the best jumping if you hit someone or if they are um in a position where they're recovering from something this is going to be the best if you want to deal the highest amount of damage after stun this is the combo jumping neutral headbutt you have to get used to the timing so you can get this one every other button deals less damage this is 100 more so that's something you have to get used to it if you get the stun and if you want to stop people from jumping that you're really close back jump light punch and back jump light kick are really good against almost everyone in the cast I have to say you can do a fussy back jump light kick catch them although the damage is so bad you really need to make sure you're going to kill with this thing against sangi Marisa and I think Lily you can do a back jump medium kick and you will hit them I think Honda also I have to check but yeah that's something you can do otherwise this generally kills if they are low on help this one body Splash is your best cross up and at the same time it's pretty awful if they know how to stop it like walk to the other side you will with it and this one for some reason has four extra recovery frames absolutely easy for the opponent to punch this thing it works is fantastic this is a frame trap almost all the time since you are so close you can delay it but the herbox heatbox combo is so bad it is so easy to be stopped in the air with something random like a standing light punch or they just wait or back dash or whatever and they punish you so don't rely on this that much my recommendation is forward jump without pressing buttons and sometimes go for the the body Splash in the corner specifically a special moves and supers let's cover every single special and super he has let's start with spds spds are a five frame command grab on the punch the range changes almost every single time you want to dry Rush After SPD here things are a little complicated depending on what they do you can either whiff something or you can get the ey or perfect parot I think the generally the best option is the standing medium punch however you never are sure again as always my recommendation is dry rushing and not doing anything at least at first you can also do the classic microw walk wheel kick if you are you don't have meter just be careful everything has a response from the opponent is the one that deals the most damage you block a minus minus 5us 6 and you're close enough for o SPD like a dry reversal that one is the the move that deals the most first of all the I one is 30 frames of recovery it has two extra or two less frames you want to see it like that you recovering 30 frames which is better for S so you have two extra frames so dry rushing after a light one is generally better for those two frames that is the only one that has that and it's the SPD you're going to use the most due to range it has a really good range especially if they pressing buttons and you get used to we punishing with this thing you're going to get a lot of damage however your R is bad B Dynamite is your combo Ender after a few well combos like super level two you can go for it to end the combo with it after a few juggles like in the corner standing heavy kick into o b so this is your mostly combo Ender and guess jump tool if you want to guess a jump use the o one cuz you have more range here the O is again horrendous your plus 19 if you drive Rush be extra careful you don't have enough frames to do something crazy so just drive rush and maybe wait or go for light SPD or C your like it in this version of The Game season two you can get it after a few punch counters you can get the regular BST or regular neutral headbutt into the BST you can buffer it regular BST and you don't need the OD one but mostly scenarios you don't have enough jugle points you're going to need to use the old one thra storm this is a we move you can Parry certain things that previously you were not like Street Fighter 5 like you can par knees everything that connects everything that is a kick and it's that kick is not airborne and connects to the upper body side of sangi you will Parry that includes dry reversals some knees some uh command normals he can Parry a lot of stuff however ping attacks low attacks they don't work dii after this is horrible you end up like to the other side of the screen you do get decent damage I guess the problem is this move is extremely slow when you're in bornout this doesn't work so it's just a weird guess it works against certain specials like bison scissor kicks donkey kick from Ryu some overheads are kicks Kimberly has a lot of kicks you can perfect Parry almost all of them you can Parry the sway of DJ so it has some Niche uses but overall this move doesn't work that well don't have don't use it unless something is very obvious don't use it Siberian Express now cyberian Express is weird too another weird move first of all you have a far version which has armor it has I think two points of armor when you start and when you start moving you have a close version which is significantly faster the issue is even though it is fast the opponent almost always can jab you out or jump out or even back dash out of the cyberian express which makes this move really difficult to land have some ways of Landing it all of them require spending meter like D rush medium punch and it has to be on block that one works if on heit you need a punish conter with certain moves it is very difficult to land it is one of those move you use sometimes just to catch your opponent doubting themselves however if you do Land one the OK is actually pretty good here you're plus 29 that means if you Dash You're plus seven which is decent if you drive rush you have light SPD standing minium punch crouching minium kick knee you have a really good set of options should you dve rush after as saberian Express or you can be cheeky I do this sometimes don't abuse it cuz it's not entirely safe you can do that larat combo Ender aner the regular one is super slow and very inconsistent I would recommend larat for jumps that are very obvious like they're jumping from there and you really see the jump and you're 100% sure you're going to hit them use larat if you're over here Things become very dicey otherwise all the larat is the better option I don't particularly like anti- aing with the larat but sometimes you have to you cannot rely on regular Lar cuz it's first of all it is 15 frames sometimes you don't hit people even though you do the regular version so if you're unsure of someone jumping and you don't know how to counter use hold theara don't don't risk it spend the 2 met alternatively you can use perfect Parry if you get you really good with it and usually you're you have enough frames to go into spine Buster or Hell stab larat Russian suplex ooh I like this I wish this move was faster or easier to land right now it is difficult to justify some people like it cuz the old version builds a lot of meter and by a lot I mean a lot for that is significant that is a lot of meter the regular one is fine that's like 50% which is roughly I think the same of SPD a little bit more than SPD you have good Oki you can drive Rush After Russian suplex either the regular version or the ODI version from that right rush you can go into standing medium punch medium SPD or knee or do nothing again you can do that too but the side switch the distance it is a move you're rarely going to use you have to really calculate how good it is to end the round with Russian sulex cuz let's say the opponent let's put this uh situation here the opponent has one super meter you have zero if you go for the Russian suplex going for you build them like 40 40% 45% of their next Super meter while you're building close to 75 a really sure super level two for second round and in some cases you can build super level two but you allow them to build three be very careful I don't necessarily recommend ending the round all the time with Russian suplex because if you get used to it that's going to be muscle memory and you're going to build them a lot of mirror if if you're not aware if you need the meter they have more than you just end around with s SPD don't don't risk it end around with this that's fine or with a combo if possible it's better for you to have a little bit more miror than them and them not having super level two or three cuz some characters like Rashid if they have super level two going to be a big difference for second round so don't end your combos or your rounds with Russian suplex all the time evaluate if it's really needed for you super level one weird antier excellent Oki situational comander you land one dve Rush after it you have medium SPD or light SPD or OD and standing medium punch the classics super level two extremely slow if you don't press anything you going into the Jackhammer plus five if you hold the stick to either direction or the path or the direction really you do a different version the four one is only plus one no Oki the back one you are still plus five but you are far from them from here thei is very extremely extremely limited if you do the held back version this one you can go for a knee that knee as you can see is plus seven on hit Plus on block I think it's plus three however if they're pressing crouching light buch they will stop this so don't realize on that my best recommendation for Oki after any of the versions except for the forward one is crouching medium kick don't risk it if you hold the button any punch for level super level two you get the jugle verion from here you can Dash and that hoki you can use a hell stab super level one I am and you have in the corner you can be cheeky you can use super level one after standing heavy kick there you go that is technically High the highest damage you can get out of the the meterless super level two or you can go into the safe jump I've seen some weird stuff I don't recommend anything what I've seen some people like to dash in me for some reason he+ 12 this is this is not a good idea at all you're plus 12 that's great I guess but you're sacrificing so much damage for super level two but I don't think it's worth it super level three get serious the game says is it is seven frames that is not the case it is six frames so you can punish a minus six like a dry reversal so don't don't trust the game the the grab is actually six frames usually your combo after old however one thing I want to point out is for you to be creative with your super level three this is something I always tell during my streams have to use it uh as a combo Ender all the time or as a wake up tool if you if you're being pressured you can be creative with it for example buffer it after certain buttons that might not make sense for the opponent like OU medium this is usually minus two this the Siberian lab classic super level three or be interesting with it you can Dash super level three you can use other moves that might not make much sense for the opponent to think you're going to Super level three like you like it biggie does this all the time or you can even use crouchy light Punch or standing light punch like the ones I recommend the best are the ones who recover fast like standing light Punch or crouchy light punch dve Rush Tri level three so on and so on so don't don't wake up with it all the time nor use it as a ender all the time try to be creative with your super level three it is a grab at the end of the day so they have to jump it back dash it think of it as another grab you have cuz that is technically what it is let's talk more about the game plan now foot seats which buttons should you use for foot seeds the most common ones are crouching light punch crouching medium kick and standing medium punch these ones are the most common if you're relatively close to the opponent and you want to bother them probably these are the ones you're going to use very very effective together specifically if you're starting the pressure with crouchy light punch for example this one if they press a four framer going to get a punish counter or counter hit depending on the button same with this one if you space yourself after a couple of ones very annoying to punish this they can back dash however they can also jump if you want to stop the jump after a few Gru light punches use a standing medium punch this will reset them in the air so you have to get used to a couple of pokes and the medium punch just in case they jump otherwise as you know you hear still in SPD range light SPD or medium SPD depending on the Range but these ones are the the ones you're going to use the most just to bother people up now as with punishers go s actually has a lot you have for start S likei as we talked about s like sweep also a good with Punisher and heavy punch excellent can still with punish with this thing like if they go for a medium and your wave you can absolutely take damage and dve from this and you can also whave punish with headbutt specifically if you again set it up with a few lights like something like boom or microw walk headbutt so you can with punish if they're pressing buttons and if you see the button within obviously like you can do he you can stay here without doing anything and if they go for I know a standing heavy punch you can boom with punish lers with headbutt frame traps the most obvious one is headbutt plus four so from here a grab hell stab and crouching light punches stop four framers remember frin traps are only good if the opponent really wants to do something if they don't you have to be very careful cuz you're going to be minus except if you use crouchy light buch so if you use something like this you're going to be minus three and this again also minus three so be careful and if they're perfect paring or mashing the Parry you also need to be extra careful cuz they can Parry this one and also this one so for those cases you have to mix it up you have to go for spine Buster if you're close SPD if you're far if you want overall this is a good frame trap All Things Considered Drive Rush has a few options for you the most common one and the one I recommend the most is driver sing medium punch from here you have a frame trap with the target combo if you do this that stops four frames the same things apply for every single frame TR by the way they can perfect Parry or they can just block it if they block the second hit you're going to be minus six but you're generally so spaced it's very difficult for them to do something so don't be scared to do this a couple of times even sometimes do the whole Target combo just because however as you know the last hit is very punishable sometimes you have to use it with than still at plus two SPD you are generally going to be in SPD range light SPD or o the SPD if you're really close when you hit this you're going to be in range for a regular throw AKA go for spine Buster so it's pretty decent my recommendation as always is to do do it wait to see if they do something sometimes go for the Target combo and sometimes go for SPD or regular grab if you want even more frames you have crouchy light punch for the plus five from here you can go into crouching medium punch sometimes it's whs I have to be honest generally I prefer Health tab cuz you can heal firm into larat overall with the plus five you get from the crouching light point you can trade with four frames with standing medium punch that is plus seven if you use crouchy medium kick you trade and that is plus eight depending on the distance again you can go into Crouch a medium Punch or Hell stop just be careful cuz Straits usually space more than other kind of combos the final one is Crouch you like it I'm just adding this one just in case cuz this is a four framer technically you're going to be plus one you can make it plus three or Plus two depending on how you hit your crou you like it however it is so strange to get the plus two but sometimes it happens let me see if I can do it there we go I hit the plus two most of the time you're going to be plus one with the plus one well they can match a for framer and your only option for that is another crouchy likei otherwise you can go into the standing light punch this has no Gap usually this has a two frame Gap with this you have none so this is a legit plus two and you're gonna be close enough for light SPD or medium SPD or you can just maybe wait there or use standing medium punch cuz the spacing is pretty decent I would recommend against doing this just just do this take the plus two it's just better anti Fireball game well the first one is super level two 18 frames the range is awful but you have to use it against Fireballs perfect Parry also that's a thing all the if you're close this only works against characters who have a reasonable her box so it's not Akuma you can W punish some Fireballs with this thing mainly can L and breu standing medium punch to trade with the Fireballs also very helpful and a slightly charge heavy Punch or dry Rush also works remember to charge it slightly in case they go for a single hit Fireball against specifically jurri and maybe in the future if we have more characters who have a lower Fireball can go over it with drop kick knee or will kick keep that in mind just in case you are fighting a Yuri and since will kick is now relatively safer to what it was I mean it is safer to what it was still pretty slow you can sometimes catch Yuri throwing the Fireball from full screen with this thing space traps o baby I love the space traps the common one and the the one I use the most is two crouching light punches into a standing medium punch this works wonders when people are mashing their for frame does not work against you can see this is a nine frame and this is only plus one technically I'm leaving eight frames over here so be careful with the crouching minion kicks this is not something you have to Abus again you have to mix it up get put into two crouching light kicks makes crouchy minium kicks whff if they wh the crouchy minum kick you can definitely go for something another headbutt or standing medium punch this one is weird I don't use it very often but it works dry brush crouchy light punch into grouchy medium punch this is a frame trap but it also spaces the head if you switch them up and you get The Grouchy medium punch dve Rush crouchy light punch this SPAC is the headbutt for a plus six this one is something I've been thinking about I'm going to add it here in case some of you want to use it crouchy light buch is spaced into another crouchy light buch is extremely good this micro step I'm doing right now is extremely extremely powerful and you can can replace that with hell stab if they're matching a four framer you will catch them with the hell stab so you can do another Crouch you light Punch or Hell St this spaces the hell St very well and if they're matching again you get the punish cter and the final one pretty common three crouchy light punches well you can use crouchy light kicks I prefer crouching light punches going to a plus three knee if you want to do this on heat you have to use four crouching light punches on block just three and then you go into a plus three Oki tools and how to get Oki the common one you the one you're going to use the most oat Dy rush I'm going to tell you something about Oki and S you either go for a strike and that strike is usually standing medium punch you go for a grab which is probably spine Buster or SPD that's that's a mixup most of the time you're going to use standing medium punch in some specific cases you can go for headbutt knee sometimes or just one of your grabs spine Buster if you're close or SVD larat in the corner you can wait you can Dash spine bster you can Dash and be plus 11 which means this is a frame trap you can Dash with D rush and you can Loop this you have so many frames after spine Buster you can use a dry Rush head if you want less frames than spine Buster you still get get OK over here plus 22 also the classic if you hit spine Buster punish cter you can use this the probably the only use for stomp just to kill frames and be either plus three to plus five I haven't talked that much about the other throws cuz to be honest spine Buster is such a good throw that it's hard to tell you about the other ones let's do that first of all these two throws are really really shiny in the corner or when you want to side switch throw it has been nerfed you're still plus eight but you're you're far you have to delay your SPD if you want to go for one otherwise you can wait there for a jump or press standing medium punch crouching medium punch is a legit midi right away so you can go for it if you want but you don't have enough plus frames if you want more plus frames crouching through the Brain Buster is actually plus 14 and while you seem to be far cuz you are compared to the other throw you have more frames from here your options are a standing heavy punch which would beat mashing you can microw walk SPD you can also wait there or you can dry brush so either either one of the two throws really help you to establish presence it'll depend on what you want you can go for back throw or Brain Buster down throw and both of them will allow you to be really well spaced in the corner easy sweep this is plus 45 so it's not that an auto time safe jump but you have to kill a couple of frames you need that Plus 43 so you need to kill those two frames with a micro step it takes time but you can definitely do something like that and that's a side jump this thing is really good super level one in terms of Oki you can just Dash MB plus 7 or dve rush for a medium SPD or standing medium Punch or knee the safe jumps this one that is a safe jump be careful with Lily Honda Marissa and JP those guys have options to beat that thing the sweep I already told you about it is plus 45 so you need to kill two frames and then jump forwards with heavy punch final one the classic at this at this point you can use super level two and do this that is also a safe jump again the same name Supply Honda Marisa JP and Lily be careful with those guys you can fake the jump just do an regular jump or fake it with drop kick and block and if they wake up matching perfect Parry they will perfect Parry your jumping attacks so be careful punish counter combos or I should say punish cont tools there's not much to say this one is good SPD whale kick really good for punish counter drop key if you're close this one headbut probably the highest damaging one if you really want to go into Super level three you technically recover the drive meter you're using for the drive Rush as you can see here technically with the second headbutt into hell stab you're going to recover it so it's a really decent combo air drop kick be careful again this can make some things work and couching heavy punch it works this is usually the combo you're going to go for even though I don't have them written down let me show you the attacks or the combos in the corner so if you get this metana drop kick you can Dash go for super level three or spds or headbutt I usually do this one if I know I'm going to end the round cuz it's around close to 4.2k damage you can use a headbutt into Super level one if you want here you keep the oi it's good if you absolutely want to end the round with super level three 5.5k the other options well kick watching heavy punch also pretty good this is the one I don't recommend but I've seen some people do that I don't like it go for the other ones the first one is the classic back jump larat hold forward hell stab super level one you can skip the health stab and go straight into Super level one it's fine you do less damage but thei again the super level one is pretty good other one I told you about neutral jump that is the highest damaging mirrorless com comb if you really want to end the round just just waste the meter you can spend more meter if you want if you have it one thing I haven't mentioned in the corner is what happens if you land at the eye this H stab into oor Oar oor that's one thing you can do my favorite is either crouching medium Punch or heal step into Super level one I think this is better good damage and again OK and OK it's something cuz I forgot when the opponent is in bornout you don't have a lot of things to do don't have a lot of options what you do get are free frame traps almost everything is going to be plus this is going to be plus five so you can technically abuse this way more you can use this without that many issues you can frame trap without the driver Rush that's mostly what I want to tell you you don't have to dve rush if they're in Burnout cuz everything is going to be plusy so don't don't get that crazy the dry brushes you don't need to just use one to get close and if they're in born out just go crazy with your buttons cuz almost everything is a frame trap you might be wondering well what do I do when I am in Burnout well that is a great question the answer is nothing really your best option is standing H punch you start holding the armor of the standing H punch is a four framer that is possibly the best thing you can do the second best option is super level two yeah crazy have to go for it for example if you go to a punch attack into the eye immediately you can go into Super level two for the side switch and the final one is super level three I I know it's not it's not the best it's very difficult to handle once s in Burnout you have you're so limited you have to hold you have to take everything until you can get a super level two three or just maybe if there's a very very very easy to see the eye you can go into the standing heavy punch and don't hold it fully cuz sometimes you can whiff it so hold it enough for the punish one thing that is notable is H if you start hitting the opponent you do recover faster so if for some reason you can take the offensive just throw a couple of Lights at least to recover a little bit faster and go for SPD or a super over here he will help you to recover faster your meter but sadly sing BN out it is really bad it's the closest to a Checkmate you'll you will get with s for your side if you do a driver Rush that has a gap they can respond so if you want gapless attacks my recommendation is like into crouching like crouching medium punch into crouching medium punch H stab into standing medium punch into crouchy light punch are the ones I recommend the most if you want to frame trap someone you do have options let's put the G to do the crouching light punch here it is a four frame yep so here you can test your frame traps the most common one by far is standing light kick into crouching have other ones that are more Niche like crouching medium punch into standing medium punch otherwise I think this is the best one and now the final part the do and don't let's go for the do the things you have to do with s use crouching light punch this is the start of your offense everything revolves around how close you are and how many crouching light punches you hit is excellent get used to poking people with this thing sometimes do nothing forwards even even sometimes you have to go crazy and dash back dash light punch this button is so important for your game plan start your offense with this thing if you're close have we punishers this is not necessarily the best way Punisher but you have with punishers also stops right brushes a spine Buster when you're plus two some sometimes plus one if you want to be s you they usually plus two plus three scenarios even plus four so what do I mean by that this is plus five but you can delay the throw this one you can grab them even this one grab them I would recommend going for spine Buster way more than any other throw in the game so that basically means SP SPD if you're in range and you're plus two try to go for spine Buster if they back dash you're going to be minus but not necessarily punishable if you go for something like the standing medium punch you're going to be minus five but still lights won't hit you here so you relatively safe if they forward jump also an issue with s you have enough time to recover with all the larat I don't think regular larat works here or super level one so go for o just in case so spine Buster technically is really low risk for a huge reward use this command normal it is pretty good to set things my only advice is don't go for something like this like round one you go for three headbutts now you're asking for someone to punish you with something you're using a 14 frame move every time you're doing this that is 10 frames of a gap between headbutts so yeah try to be smart with it a couple of Lights you don't do anything headbutt you don't do anything headbutt you speed them something like that Dy Rush standing medium punch and heavy punches these two are going to save your life but if you have no idea how to get in driver brush do nothing sometimes driver Rush hold the heavy punch a little bit or just go for Dy Rush standing punch you're going to be plus and you're going to be not necessarily close but you're going to establish your presence use sweep as a Whi Punisher issue with sweep is little players just sweep out of nowhere like they want to do something like boom boom sweep that is not how you have to use sweep sweep is a whff Punisher it's not made to poke people with have to whff punish with sweep get used to seeing people and see what they do they throw a fireball and you block it and then they throw a sing medium kick then there a good moment to sweep them to get the punish counter what you want is the punish counter and once you get the punish counter just need and you're going to be plus 11 or you can Dash Crouch your light punch let me plus eight welome block welome block this is like a core element with S Walk block walk block don't try to be that aggressive you're playing a Grappler with really slow buttons you're not playing jury not playing Akuma your SPD is your five framer you don't have a five framer you have a four framer and a six framer that means this is your five frame poke what does that mean if the oppon is minus 5 - 6 this is usually your punish and consider the light one as another poke which is weird but that is how it has to be with s now what do I mean by that don't go necessarily all the time for a tick R which is something pretty common with sangi players like they they really want to do like two hits SPD all the time if they whiff they're whiffing and you don't know what to use and you feel something like it's either too slow for the B they're using like a light just walk back in SPD think of it as a five framer let's say you're poking someone and you're waiting they don't do anything and microw walk SPD not necessarily because it is a grab it's because that would be your five framer if you have one you will probably poke like that use SPD defensively and also as a poke quote unquote the heavy ones and medium ones and OD require a little bit of a setup cuz they have less range than light one but think about again light one as a as a possible poke CU consider this I'm over here and I can grab them with SPD which is basically the range of some five framers in the game use your five framer SPD against D rushes you can stop them with crouching LI or crouching light punch most of the time even sending medium punch but sometimes you have to use SPD cuz you don't have enough frames you don't know what to do between C like and Cy light punch light SD the don't oh baby the don'ts abusing these buttons in no particular order knee the medium kick these buttons usually get sangi players kill they either go for way too many standing medion kicks maybe they got used to the season 2 standing medium kick now this is basically the season one range so they get used to poking people with this and whiffing all the time you're whiffing for 19 frames even though the herbox is really good they can sweep you they can dry rush you they can use supers you're whing for 19 frames be careful same with this thing technically you're whiffing for 13 frames but the startup the active frames it's very easy to rec recogniz so they can sweep you they will punch you in wheel kick if you use it like a madman and try to be close with them they can use a crouchy medium punch crouching medium K can really really throw you into a world of hurt but that is not the use of those buttons those buttons are not made to be abused in fact I would say even the thing with s is that he's very limited so you don't want to open yourself up for something you cannot with punish so what do I mean by that lights that's why you use so many lights with s CU these ones are are safer than other things he has that doesn't mean you don't have to use standing medium punch as I said don't abuse your buttons specifically your slower ones or if you're going to abuse them you make make sure your opponent is not reacting to them charge heavy punch even though this is a plus frame situation for S plus three this is so easy to punish just don't use it or if you're going to use it again make sure the opponent is not reacting they can sweep they can super they can forward jump they can even forward grab you so be careful this is get used to charging it slightly instead of charging it fully or just tap it it's going to make a huge difference people who SPD all the time this is a generally a bad idea they always want to SPD like they want to drive Rush SPD they want to hit someone with light SPD or medium punch SPD that is a bad idea because SPD even though you deal a huge amount of damage specifically with the OD and heavy versions your Oak is absolutely horrendous so you're going to drve rush afterwards the if the opponent is ready they're going to be perfect piring or crouching medium punch all of your options or even the eye so be extremely careful you want to use SPD cuz you have to the pressure of getting a spine Buster is far greater even though you're dealing less damage SPD is for punishing something with a huge amount of damage like you block a right reversal and they're minus six you go for the O SPD that's a lot of damage that's how you want to use it but otherwise the pressure you get from just poking or spine Buster is so so significant even though it is way less damage this is for ending rounds for establishing presence for letting them know you want to SPD more than the SPD itself again the fear of SPD is far greater than the SPD itself ending combos with regular Lariat I know sometimes you don't want to use OD larat cuz you don't have the meter and I understand that but if you have the meter absolutely go for o larat you're going to recover the uh the meter I'm coming I recovered half of a mirror by that headbut and that is a plus 10 headbutt that means I do have a guaranteed full up I almost recovered one meter the meter I use for dry rush if I get the hit that is basically a free dry rush so don't be that scared to go for the dry Rush after the OD larat however that is in the middle of the screen you're close to the corner or you are in the corner right now for regular larat you don't have to use OD here in the middle of the screen almost always go for OD larat dry brush being overly aggressive this is something I've seen a lot of sang players do first of all the dry Rush this is fine but dry rush for sangi is so insignificant because people can just dry reversal every single dver rush they can dry reversal even the gap less ones this one that has no gaps or this one even those they can dry reversal and there's nothing you can do you just take the dry reversal same with this one so the Dy reversal on block is something you have to be very careful about you want to use this cuz sometimes you have to you have to sometimes take the the Tor back with an SPD even or a spine bster you are forced in some situations to do that but don't overly go for the aggressiveness sang is not really good at being aggressive you're going to basically burn out yourself let's say you go for SPD or you go for super level three you connect it that move and now you want to drive rush I've seen people do this you in Burnout in less than a second two seconds and then you can lose your round Drive Rush is something you have to be very careful with s if you're not getting a counter hit or a punish cter be careful with the dry Rush you're wasting 3 m if you do it on heit or on block you have to expect with that much meter spent you want to get something out of that situation if the opponent is just blocking then don't do it again you're wasting your mirror go for a grab poking get them to burn out and generally whiffing buttons this is something I've seen again a lot of s players they don't know how to space themselves so they go for random sweeps random standing medium punches random medium kicks let me tell you San has a lot of recovery frames so if you want to weave something you scouch your light punch don't go crazy with sending medium kick to medium kick you're giving away frames in this game with so many fast dve rushes with so many crazy stuff like like bis and scissors you don't want to be whing getting in a position where whing is somewhat less of a risk like someone like something here after two lights really you're going to whip something there you're too close to whiff oh yeah be be careful cuz even full screen you can get some punishes like imagine you're whiffing your s medium punch and or or I don't know your strip NY goes for the super level two there's nothing you can do I I as always even though I wrote some things and as I was developing the video I realized I had to talk about other things I feel this is mostly what you need to know about sangi generally speaking sanif is a defensive character almost everything works more as a defensive tool rather than an offensive one you can make and convert some buttons to be offensive like sending medium Punch or even knee sometimes generally idea of sang is to wait for the opponent to do something they with and then you respond that is how more or less you play the character you can get crazy but only when the opponent allows you to do so and no one wants to be close to S not even another s so you have to expect they want to jump they want to backd they want to mash buttons you have to expect and since you have to guess yourself what kind of thing what kind of situation they want to go for my general recommendation is for you to wait at least the first few interactions if you get the plus the Plus for wait don't go for SPD right away or a spine Buster see what they want to do also I've seen a lot of people paring going for crazy pares all the time it's s if you want to Parry defensively as always I mean as every character in the game I think you parry your Fireballs ideally you want to perfect parry and then start walking or dashing if they're going for a string like three lights Parry between the lights cuz you don't have good tools defensively your super level two is not really good for being a defensive tool your super level three arguably you can use it but mostly your defensive tools are crouchy like it which sucks perfect Parry which can give you something really decent either SPD spine Buster or in some cases C you heavy punch another defensive option you have is wake up with dry reversal the issue with the wake up dry reversal is how easy it is to bait you can bait it can Nal jump it which is also an issue you can't rely fully on that what it beats are throws and mides well midi throws too basically throw midi throws reg throws or any throw mes M the eyes everything that hits you when you're waking up dry reversal on wake up Beats them exception of Lights which will go too fast and super level three those are your defensive options so you have to get used to paring on defense not don't try to Parry all the time Parry on defense when the opponent is showing you they want to abuse something that could be parried Parry your safe jumps also Parry safe jumps be careful with s it is a fun character he has more tools that is for sure we can debate how strong or weak he is but this is mostly to tell people how you have to play s in 2024 this was a long one I hope you enjoyed this video If you really liked it please subscribe if you have a new s player over there that you want to show something in order to get enam with the character please do please use this video they might get something out of it take care uh I hope you had a great week I don't know how when I'm releasing this it's going to take like a bunch to edit take care have fun keep playing Grapplers and I'll see you in the next one bye-bye
