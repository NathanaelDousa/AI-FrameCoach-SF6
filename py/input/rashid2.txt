hey what's up guys Vesper here I hope you guys are enjoying Rishi so this is going to be a five essential tips video uh to help you guys learn Rasheed as quickly as possible so let's get started on anti-airs because that's like the most important subject so rasheed's best and core anti-air is this heavy spinning mixer by far so a heavy spinning mixer is really good because you can do it really early as soon as you see them jump and it's gonna hit on both sides too so even if somebody crosses you up it's basically like a spinning layer that goes upwards it's very very strong just keep in mind that it doesn't have ant hair invincibility on the first frame so that means if somebody is already in the process of hitting you over the head this isn't gonna work in that case you gotta do the OD version of the mixer if it's very very deep so it'll take a while to get to know the difference but in the meantime like I said as soon as you see him jump in the air just do heavy mixer as soon as possible and that'll get you started in some cases too you want to use medium spinning mixer medium spinning mixer also has anterior invincibility but it's the same thing where you can't use it on the first frame uh this is good when someone's near the corner because then you could do like OD for a follow-up you want a bit more damage or you can go into uh your level one super so that's another situational anti-air crouching medium punch is also an entire this is actually really fast this starts up in six frames the only thing is is that the the anterior hitbox on this thing it's like right on the tip so you got to make sure you press this button nice and early if you press a little too late like right here you'll get a trade so press it nice and early it's mostly for opponents that are around in front of you and the 45 degree angle in front of you uh but it can be good it can be good as long as you uh time it fast like this your standing heavy kick is also an ant here but this is super situational this comes out so slowly but if you do have an answer with it at least you get an added reward uh by being able to do mixer after it I just oh my god look how look how early I had just hit this thing but yeah you get a mixer after uh which is just a little bit more damage and it looks like you're showing off too if I can get a four medium punch from this as well like that that's a pretty good conversion but I don't recommend using this as an anti-air also there's your level one super it's reliable unlike zangies uh of course it's a super so it's hard to do in a pinch but big reward if you land it and if you get it deep enough to get a side switch too which is great if someone tries to finish you off jumping at you while you're in the corner which is great I tend to use this against like characters that do like dive kicks and stuff even though dive kicks are fast as soon as I you know I'm buffering the super as soon as I see them jump I do the level one which is just reliable because you know it's a strike Invincible also don't forget you got an air throw rashid's air throw is actually really good because it pushes them forward really good for people trying to jump out of the corner and finally jumping medium punch is also very good because it puts them in a Juggle State and it's cancelable so they'll do some unique follow-ups especially when people are in the corner last answer I'll mention is rasheed's four medium punch this is not an anti-air but a lot of people like to neutral jump against Rasheed or they jump backwards in the corner if you see them doing that they're in front of you swap them with a forward medium punch into an ego Spike very good to turn against that all right essential tip number two rasheed's important normals I know I named way more than five tips already but whatever let's just keep going okay important normals go through this really fast so rasheed's too fast as normals is a standing light punch and standing light kick uh they're both four framers the difference is is that signing light punch chains and you want to go into your uh medium speed spinning mixer for Rasheed because it causes a knock down uh this also works when the opponent is crouching so don't worry about that really really good I guess you could do a resting with light spinning mixer I'll leave you a plus in front of his face you can threaten the throw or the strike uh but the light kick the reason you want to use this is even though it's not as plus I think it's plus three instead of plus four uh this can go into his light ego Spike where his light punch can't go into it so know this for a little bit more damage and of course uh knock down and Corner carry rashid's got two buttons that are Plus on block Rashid standing medium punch is plus one and his crouchy meme punch is also plus one so when you're going for pressure and tick throws crouching me and is ideal because the pushback is way less you're almost in throw range you just need to tiptoe forward and you can grab them when you do that with medium punch you're way too far to go for a grab you'll get jabbed out you're gonna have to frame trap them at that point so know that like for example when I cross up I like to go into crouching medium punch just puts me in a more threatening range however when you hit the opponent with these buttons uh the conversions are more rewarding for the standing medium punch because standing medium punch goes into his Target combo which of course leads into you know a lot of corner carry actually that was a bad combo I didn't even show that this this is the combo you want to do you want you want the corner card you want to run to kick there you go and then go into medium or heavy uh spinning mixer when you use this crouching medium punch you can go into standing light kick though which isn't the end of the world and once again you can go into ego Spike so know the differences between those two mediums you're a plus that's the important thing jumping medium kick is your cross up jumping crouching heavy punch is a hop and in the corner it allows you to combo so this is really good when you stun your opponent or give you a second chance if they block your jump in and you can do a full you know conversion from this all right rasheed's best pokes obviously crouching medium kick is one of them because it's a cancelable low attack really really good but uh Rasheed standing medium kick don't sleep on this button this button is excellent folk I use it all the time and if you happen to land a counter hit with head it combos into itself which is convenient or if you're close enough you can go to crouchy medium kick into an eagle Spike do you standing medium kick a lot standing heavy kick is also a great whiff punish tool if you punish counter them then of course you get a little conversion from it if someone's doing it like an attack that's like really far away you know like I don't know a Manon is using standing heavy kick or uh a Marisa player is doing a Gladius on you heavy kick is the way to go one more button you should keep in mind is rasheed's Ford heavy kick this goes over those pesky crouching medium kick characters so if Ryu walks forward into this thing you can hit them out of this with forward heavy kick really really good and you get a full conversion from this but if you're not a footsie kind of guy and you're all about the Anga then just drive Rush forward heavy kick with Rasheed it's really good has a lot of momentum blows up lows and your soul plus you can combo standing medium punch Afters and go into a Target combo if they block it uh don't worry about that because I'll get ready to do a light punch here uh you're plus enough or you can counter hit them with your own light punch which is very convenient and I guess uh you can ongo with his forward heavy punch as well the overhead uh that will be safe on block as well if you hit them you can also go into Target combo so that's very convenient all right essential tip number three rasheed's anti-zoning tools rashid's got a bunch of them so let me go over them from best to worst so I think the best one is rasheed's old vskill one from Street Fighter 5. so you do Arabian Cyclone use the light punch version because it starts up the fastest now you see that little Row in front of Rasheed that's also a projectile so if someone's throwing a fireball at you you can use that to nullify a firewalls just know you have to do it very early very preemptive otherwise you're gonna get swapped in the fireball just like that uh when you do the roll it goes underneath every Fireball in the game so far except for jury but don't worry we have a solution for a jury so really really good even projectiles you wouldn't think you'd go under like Sonic booms or uh double air slasher from DJ it'll go under everything so don't worry so you're gonna get into a situation where it's kind of hard to throw this out because you're gonna get hit by the Fireballs like this but don't forget Rasheed has his own Fireball so use your Whirlwind shots to trade here and then when you see your opening once you get into the Rhythm you can do it early and then roll and go in I like to roll and throw uh if you happen to roll under as they throw the fireball you'll get a punish counter or a counter hit and then you can go into you know a full combo something like this something like this you know the combo I've showed you guys like a million times now once again I know it's hard to squeeze out the Arabian Cyclone when someone's throwing non-stop Fireballs at you so when you're doing the fireball war with them don't forget to get a little greedy sometimes and then charge your shot a little bit so it does two hits that way when they throw a fireball you'll get a little space in between where they can't they'll get hit right and then you can squeeze this out if they're throwing it out you know blindly and don't forget about your own OD shot right your own OD shot if you catch something on normal fire you get the knock down and then once again if they're careless with it then you can go for the roll if they still continue the zone now the alternative option is to go for the old V scale 2 from Street Fighter 5 and that is the back kick from the Arabian Cyclone that'll make you fly forward this is good because it goes full screen but it doesn't have projectile invincibility so the opponent ever throws a fireball while you're doing this you're gonna get hit out of the air so this is something you're going to want to use after you knock someone down the closest distance on his owner after you've already won with like an OD shot or you catch them sleeping you nullify with the light Arabian cyclone and then you go in afterwards but it's not the absolute best option but the V skill 2 option of course is good against the jury because you go right over the fire bomb you can hit her so that's very convenient when you're full screen away don't forget about the cartwheel hop if you do it without pressing any direction you'll land in front and if you're full screen away and you hold forward you'll get a cross up with it now of course your the cartwheel is not Invincible to Fireball so you're gonna have to probably throw an OD shot and then cartwheel towards them finally there's the Run slide I'm not a fan of the Run slide because uh it takes too long to wind up once again you got to do the dash and then you gotta run and slide and if you hit them it's side switches and uh it's unsafe on block if you don't space it perfectly so I would put this as the weakest option but once again if you're full screen to win you're desperate you probably have to use an OD shot to get some room in and then yeah start your engines and then run uh with punch even though I said the slide is probably the worst option it does actually have projectile and vulnerability on it so as long as you get it out uh you don't have to worry about getting hit by a fireball even a ground Fireball like a jury for example it'll go right through it alright essential tip number four throw Loops that's right I'm showing throw Loops in a Basics guide even a beginner can do this even if you don't even know what throw Loops are so I have Ryu to do his fastest button when he wakes up it's going to be a standing light punch so all you got to do with Rasheed is you throw and then you dash forward and then you wait a slight moment and then you throw again uh this only works in the corner and then you'll see well Dash wait throw flash wait throw and you keep doing it you keep doing it until they die uh you can mix it up too after the fourth throw you can dash for it and then back up and then you know you can shimmy them and then do whatever you want um but keep in mind that even though I'm not a fan of midi setups or any type of thing without a kill frame uh since they're so possible Rashid I think it's plus nine even you press the throw just a tad too early you'll still throw them anyways because you're just so Plus so once again to do this fourth throw in the corner and then immediately Dash wait a slight moment and then forward throw again okay and finally essential tip number five using rasheed's win mechanics super important to really make this character shine so for example if you just do a normal Eagle Spike doesn't matter which strength the opponent can punish you super hard any character without using any meter can just Dash in and you're done so but if you use the wind the ego Spike becomes super annoying super safe you fly full screen you do massive damage if you happen to hit them so you want to abuse this so there's two core moves that give Rashid the wind buff the first is charging any of his Fireballs you just hold the button down and you'll see this tornado right in front of Rishi for a very small moment whenever you do any move that can be enhanced in front of that tornado or on it you'll get the win buff so charge any of his fireballs and that includes the OD version as well and you'll get the tornado or the OD version only the OD version of his Arabian Cyclone so this one and you'll notice the tornado actually stays on the screen for just a little bit longer so those are the two core moves that he can get the win buff besides obviously his level two where everything is you know the win buff from the giant tornado so when you use the wind enhance the third buttons 2 is for a medium punch it's -3 on block so it's safe to throw out if you want to close the distance on them uh using the win for your cartwheel is very strong as well because you can just run in and throw them it improves your run you just run forward throw them as well very very good you can use this forward heavy kick if they try to stop you with a low you'll fly right over there low and hit them when you use it on mixer especially very good your plus two in their face so that means you can go for a grab right you can go for a counter hit setup you can go for uh crouching light punch the crouching light kick is really good hold on let me turn on counter hit you can go like this very very good after that because they're plus two so let me show you a quick example we will Mash jab as soon as he blocks so if I hit him with this it's airtight he can't even move and if he presses a button after I can counter hit him no problem I could show you again I'll just Mash throw this time and as you can see I win I get a counter hit um also if you happen to hit them uh they're gonna be in for a ride because you can call them to another mixer or if they're close enough to the corner you can do three mixers which I've been doing a lot on the stream which is really really fun don't forget you can just jump at them too you don't even have to do a special move you can just cross them up with that so rashid's got a lot of Mobility options to hit the opponent with and don't forget guys if you're looking for Rashid combos we already have the combo guide up on the Channel with tons of examples there and then in the future I'm gonna release like you know the big Rasheed guide and I'll go over everything I've learned on my way to master rank so hopefully this video has been helpful I know it's been really basic if you have any questions I'll try to answer them in the comments below and uh there'll be a ton more Rishi guides this is just to get you guys started so thanks for watching and I'll see you guys next time peace foreign
