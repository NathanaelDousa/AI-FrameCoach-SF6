hi if you want to learn Jamie fast but don't know where to start this is the guide for you this video is going to go over Jam's basic tools at every range how he has a deep tool kit although complicated and show you how to take these tools and create pressure from them like anti-airs follow-ups and wall splatter combos but one of the ways to set those combos up is to have a strong anti-air game now like most characters Jamie has a really good crouching Fierce for anti-air but you want to use things like his light kick Arrow kick hard kick Arrow kick to stop people in their tracks and create pressure that's not the only way he can anti-air to create pressure look at this Jamie has a kick called the tensei kick which allows you to jump cancel into a medium punch hard kick dive kick and gives you pressure right after with a Crouch and medium punch and now that you have anti-airs and you can move forward think about how to use your neutral tools and best buttons to win more games and Jam's best buttons are pretty straightforward they're kicks stand meeting kick crouching meeting kick standing hard kick and crouching hard kick are your go-to buttons for traps with punishes and pressure so for example here that one move led to a mey where you can then do stand medium punch which is plus and then get another drink opportunity on that counter hit so we have to talk about drinks if we're going to talk about jamy because most players don't know if you don't get a drink you're not going to win a game so let me help you do that so number one drinks help you do more damage all of your damage goes up and especially special moves show even a 300 increase in this OD Arrow kick and it's not just more damage it's also more situations as you see in this clip having level one drink allows you to have much better Corner carry into a guaranteed mixup so what about level two well jamy has a break dance move which is quarter Circle forward plus light kick which allows you to get medy attacks on the opponent's wake up now if they don't want to block do the same thing except for Block on their wake up and then punish them for the attempt one of my biggest regret is not using this safe jump until way into Master don't be me but once you're level three you get access to command grab an easy target combo Punisher and if you're level four you want to go into the double pal which is only available in level four into CA if you got it as we mentioned earlier just getting the drinks is difficult so let me show you some easy and safe ways to increase your drink levels and get access to those moves those combos and that damage so good drinkers like to space out their opponents like this where you space out the OD Palm like in this Freeze Frame here and look for the whff punish to get a quick drink combo if you're feeling lucky press parry and land a hard kick to go straight into a double drink but if you're in the corner I do recommend OD reca for plus one into pressure because if they keep mashing you keep drinking and if they stop mashing start throwing them in the corner with this throw Loop and if you dash up and block it's safe from things like DP or even super but if you want to get more damage from an opponent who's challenging you press D medium punch and get a counter hit into a sweep into a drink into plus Raves into winning and if they want to jump out of the corner make them pay by using your T side kick and dive kicking them for pressure then a lot of players like to jump back in the corner well Jamie has answers for that too with his classic DP now the opponent's in the same situation again and sometimes this means the opponent will just block and if so get them with a wall bounce in the corner into a palm into a combo of your choice critical art or maybe just a Rea or Arrow kick for more pressure my personal favorite is a little bit of damage and you get a drink at the end let me show you when you do this combo you have to delay the stand light kick to juggle with st Fierce into crouching hard kick you have to practice practice it it's awesome now if you don't have super try to do this with the stand Hard Punch gives you a perfect mey to throw the opponent after if they like to block and if they're blocking and burnt out they can be stunned against the wall like this you can get two drinks and combo into a third drink especially if it's early in the round if it's later in the round don't hesitate to go into level three and then combo into another scenario that leads you into a further drink this power Jamie up and allows you to keep working your offense and maybe even do a mixup into a command grab and this allows you to again build drinks build damage help you win more games but there's so much more to Jamie that I want to share with you in the next video where we'll go over Advanced Co topics and advanced tips that should help you be able to land different level three scenarios and help you understand how to get the most out of your Jamie see you there
