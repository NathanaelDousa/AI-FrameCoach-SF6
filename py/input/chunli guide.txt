so you want to play the best character in the game Chun Le yes the best character in the game at least until my comes out but put some respect on my character man this my character I I love playing Chun chun's my character anyway today we're going to be getting into a beginner Chun leag guy before you click off the video and just think oh this is only for beginners this video is going to be containing a lot of sauce and as a Chun Lee m i included a lot of like Niche tech for this character this is going to be a indepth die I want to throw it out there in a way to where beginners can also understand and grasp the character so a couple things you want to know about Chun before loading into your first match are she is a very footsie based character she's very strong in footsies so footsies is basically this range playing in this range she has very long range normals which are very good chun's jumping it's kind of floaty she kind of has a floaty jump compared to other characters so because of that later on you're not going to want to jump in as often especially as your opponents get better at anti- aing which is why I like her buttons her buttons are very strong very strong buttons very long range like I said you can outrange pretty much everybody on the cast the sacrifice of a jump being floaty and easily able to be anti-ed I'll take that so the buttons that I throw out the most in neutral in this footsy range Ford medium Punch or back medium punch it's the same move back medium punch forward medium punch same move another button I'll use is crouching medium kick very good button you got to utilize the crouching medium kicks standing heavy punch this button has a little bit more of a specific use but we'll get into that in a little bit and standing jab stand jab very good button very long range I think he got a little bit of a Nerf over time but it's still a very good button now she can also abuse game mechanics a little bit in Fireball Drive rush you have to to charge her Fireball and you can throw a fireball and drive Rush this is another good way of getting in so if you want to do Fireball Drive rush you can either throw out the light or medium Fireball and follow it up with a drive rush and that can lead to any conversion but something about Chun is that she's very Drive meter dependent which means most of your offense a lot of your combos are going to require you to use meter so you don't want to be doing Fireball driv too much you also want to learn how to play without using driver rushing which is like I said her buttons she has very good buttons you can also do Fireball dri rush into her overhead this is different than the other driver scenarios because in the other scenarios you're able to combo your button from your Fireball but in this situation I use the overhead to catch opponent's pressing down back to block you're able to get the overhead and then you can convert that into a [Music] combo but this is the problem with the combo your driver Rush combo goes Drive Rush overhead standing medium punch crouching medium punch into heavy spinning bird kick however I do find inconsistency with this combo because St medium Punch May whiff or crouching medium Punch May whiff so you may get the hit you may be able to confirm into the combo but you might drop the combo all together just because of the range of the buttons it's kind of weird you want to know something kind of crazy like 91% of the people that watch my videos are not subscribed which I think is kind of crazy we're on the push to 1K so if you got any sort of value out of this video all I ask is that you drop a like in the video a sub and let me know if you're going to main Chun I'll show you guys a couple of combos that I like to do off of these buttons but for the most part when I land a Ford Med punch I'll like to drive Rush After and also if I land a Crouch medum kick I'll like to drive Rush after it's just way easier to hit confirm instead of just Landing a raw crouching medium kick and then doing a special move right after it's very hard to hit confirm that so if you do like a crotch medum kick into medium legs on block that is very punishable so that's why I like to drive R it gives me a little bit more time to hit confirm the button so here I'll show you guys a couple combos that you want to learn side note it's pretty much the same combo if I land for medium Punch or crouching medium kick I'll pretty much go into the same combo variation next we'll be going into a couple of combos that you can get off of your standing jab or stand light punch this is basically your light light light combos now next we're going to talk about standing heavy punch this button at the beginning of the video I said it has a little bit more of a specific use and the reason for that is looking for a counter hit now the thing about getting a counter hit is that it gives you a couple more frames of Advantage if you want to learn a little bit about the vocabulary being used in this video if you don't know what frame traps are if you don't know what Oki is if you don't know what frame advantages I have videos of that on the channel feel free to check out some of the other playlists that will definitely help in if you're trying to come up in your Street Fighter Journey so standing heavy punch is used to look for counter hits if you can land this button in a counter hit you will be able to confirm that into a combo now let's say your opponent Blocks Your standing heavy punch you can go into something called a block string just because your opponent blocks your button does not mean it's immediately their turn it could be their turn but that doesn't always mean that they can take a turn you can do something called a spacing trap so standing heavy punch for Chun is minus three which means if I try to press another button immediately after and Akuma presses any button faster than what I'm pressing he will be able to take his turn back and I will get counter hit so let's say while I'm fighting my opponent I notice that they like to press a button after I press my standing heavy punch I can beat this by using a strategy called spacing trap I can do another button that will be out of range causing them to whiff their jab and I will get a whiff punish it's kind of like an automatic whiff punish so for Chun that is her stance medium kick so standing heavy punch into stance medium kick and as you can see you get the punish counter so then you can convert that into a combo Ender or extend it with a driver's combo you have to be careful though because if you miss space your spacing trap you can actually get hit out of it now let's say you're throwing out stand heavy punch and your opponent is not pressing a button after you can go into a block string and that block string will be standing heavy punch Dan light kick and end with Fireball now the reason you want to go into this block string is you want to look to see if you can get a hit confirm if they block out all your pressure you basically return back to neutral or they'll try to take their turn back but if they do not block you can hit confirm the stance kick into a combo Ender now let's say your opponent's kind of far away but they whff a very punishable button or move either a DP or they just whiff a button in general or they whiff a super I like to use standing heavy punch if I'm very far away and I can get a nice punish counter combo standing heavy punch is a very good button however it does lose to di so that is part of the reason why you don't want to throw it out too much in neutral yes it's very good yes it has good block strings yes there are a lot of good that come with this button but it's also with punishable and it loses to di now we're going to be talking a little bit about her special moves chun's special moves are very good but they are also situational meaning in certain situations you want to use certain moves first we'll be talking about light hantu I rarely use this move because it is minus 9 on block and this distance basically makes it very punishable so if your opponent blocks this they will have a free punish so I don't really like to use light hantu medium hantu very similar it's minus three meaning they can try to take their turn back it also puts you at Point Blank Range so if you try to press any button immediately after this and they press they'll be able to take their turn back first but this is safe so if you're anticipating something and you throw a medium hantu and they block it at least you're not going to get punished but you cannot continue your offense they're going to take their turn back and another version of hantu is heavy hantu heavy hantu also minus one meaning if you try to press jab or something and they press jab they'll be able to take their turn back that's why hansu is like an iffy move if they block it you can either get punished or they take the turn back so you're kind of just giving away your turn for free but what I like to use hantu for is if my opponent is just brainlessly throwing Fireballs I like to use heavy hantu and convert that into a punish counter combo so it's a very specific use for hantu I use it a lot versus Fireball characters but it's only when I anticipate that they're going to throw out a fireball you can space out medium hantu like this far and this is is fine at least you're not in throw range you're not putting yourself in throw range heavy hantu you're kind of putting yourself in the throw range so if you space on medium fine enough you won't be in throw range they'll press a button most likely but at least you won't have to guess between if they're going to press a button or throw you next is OD hantu personally I don't really use OD hantu but it's kind of like a surprise move it's very fast meaning your opponent may not react to it and it costs two bars of Drive meter so that's another reason why I don't really use it I rather use my drive meter for other things than like a surprise attack like oh because they could easily block this and if they block it then it's like well you kind of just wasted two bars of drive but if you land ODI honi you can basically go into level one or level three or do like tentro after I believe yeah that's pretty much how you use hantu I pretty much only use the heavy I'll use the medium so now we're going to be talking about chun's legs pause we're going to be talking about chun's lightning legs and spinning bird kick both of these two specials are very good and you usually tend to end your combos with either lightning legs or spinning bird kick but let me tell you how I strategize between using the two so if I'm in the midscreen I'll always go for spinning bird kick like 90% of the time I'll go for spinning bird kick and the reason for that is because spinning bird kick gives you a lot of corner carry very good Corner carry if I do the same combo but end in legs yes I get the damage and basically I did a combo but you don't really get that same Corner carry so most of the time when you do land your combos you want to go into spinning bir kick because you as a Chun player want to get your opponent in the corner she's very very very good in the corner you'll see later in the video sauce this character very fun I love playing this character so if you come to me and you say slam when do I use legs well you can end a combo with legs if you want to do something called a frame trap and I'll get this with people a lot so the Mind Game behind this is usually when you land a special move your opponent can then take your turn back right look at hantu for example if you throw a h you almost in every scenario your opponent can press a button and take the turn back so I kind of use that same philosophy with lightning legs if I landine a combo and I end with medium legs or light legs I can try to take my turn back because it's plus three after it hits so this plus three right here it basically means it's still my turn I can continue in my pressure so a lot of people will see legs and it's it's like a knowledge check they won't know to not press the button and they press and you can get another combo so I'll show you what that looks like first you want to make sure your button hits light legs is plus three medium legs is also plus three you'll just want to end in medium legs so you can get that extra bit of damage on block light legs is minus8 medium legs is also minus8 so you don't want to be pressing a button after this your opponents can take their turn back and actually punish you for doing those legs on block which is another reason why you don't always want to be spamming special moves in neutral so you want to make sure you get the hit and then you can convert into a combo but because you're still plus three you can continue your pressure and take your turn back but let's say your opponent doesn't know this and they actually press after medium legs I like to go into crouching medium punch and extend my combo with a driver shter so it'll look something like this now for heavy legs I don't really use heavy legs a lot you can use heavy legs if you land like a crouching heavy Punch or something the only real reason why I'll use heavy legs in midscreen on block is if I'm trying to deplete their Drive gauge so I'll do something like this and as you can see that took away almost one bar of Drive meter so if they're low on meter I'll use heavy to try to attack their meter and the reason why I use heavy legs is because it is minus three which means it's safe so I don't have to worry about them punishing me for doing legs on block we also have OD legs this move can hit twice you do the regular quarter Circle forward two kicks to get the OD version and then you press two kicks again to get the follow-up attack all for two bars of meter however I don't really use both the hits I don't really use this move in general when I do use this move I use it to cancel into supers it combos into level two and to level three but not level one for spinning bird kick you have to charge it so you have to hold down and then you press up and any kick and you'll get one of the three variations for spinning bir kick light medium or heavy for most combos you'll want to end in either heavy or medium spinning bird kick but the spinning bird kick I want to talk about is OD spinning bird kick this is a very good way to extend your combos so let's say instead of ending in a regular spinning brick bir kick if you do your same combo but you end an OD spinning bird kick you get the following follow-ups another time when all use heavy legs is in Burnout so for those of you that don't know when your opponent is burnt out every button you press gets an additional four frames of frame Advantage so if I do heavy legs now while Akuma is in burnouts I will be plus one instead of minus three and this means I can actually continue my pressure because I can frame trap with stand jab so let's say Akuma tries to press a button I can counter hit him out of this so right here I'm going to show you the burnout Loop if your opponent's trying to press and get out of this burnout pressure they're not going to be able to so it's very strong if you want to get your stun combo in the corner so I'll use medium hantu medium hantu also becomes plus one in burnouts heavy hant becomes plus three but I found a little bit of inconsistency using this because when they Crouch you can actually side switch if you're too close and you do heavy hantu you'll side switch and they can whiff punish you see so you can accidentally s switch if you're cooking up too hard and you do this heavy hantu you'll accidentally Sid switch if you do medium hantu you don't Sid switch unless you're way too close to them so I find this to be a little bit more consistent so the burnout pressure that I like to go for is stand jab Crouch medum kick hantu and then to space them out and also be plus I'll do the same thing stand jab Crush medium kick and end with heavy legs and then I'll just Loop that pressure so this is like my version of chun's burnout pressure Chun also has a leges but you don't really want to be doing it like this high in the sky Chun has a variation called instant air legs where you can do it immediately as you leave the ground now there is a shortcut to doing this normally you jump and then input air legs but to do this variation you input legs first and then jump so you do quarter Circle forward jump and then press kicks this has a very nice use some sauce if you will I'll include that it'll be later on in the video but just know this right here you can set up for some cool stuff and now we will be talking about the stance cancel Serenity stream or stance as you'll here it be called a lot of people have trouble with this and I had a lot of trouble with this as well from the start so I'm going to show you a couple ways you can get better at doing stance console first of all it's quarle back and punch you can do it using any of the three punches light medium or heavy Punch If you do quar cicle punch once it'll put her in stance and if you do it again it'll take her out of stance so you can do a easy stance on stance you can also do stance and hold down or down back and she will stay in stance as as long as you hold down and once you let go down she will immediately stand up if you input stance and do nothing she will stay in stance and after a short while she'll automatically get out of stance herself if you do stance and then press a button you will get a move so if I do stance light kick stance medium kick stance light punch stance medium punch I will get moves now the thing about these four moves is that you will be able to stay in stance after these moves however if you do stance heavy punch or heavy kick they will automatically take you out of stance now if you want to get better at inputting stance I'll give you an order in how you want to practice because this is how I practice so first you just want to get used to doing stance itself you might want to practice doing stance on stance as you walk across the screen and then you might want to switch to the other side you want to make sure to practice this on both sides next you want to get used to doing stance and then pressing a button of your choice so whatever move that you want to do that's what you want to practice so let's say I want to do light kick practice that maybe I want to do St medium kick maybe I want to do stance light punch you want to practice doing stance and then pressing a button if you're finding your opponent and you do a block string involving stance another way to get out of stance quickly is by doing a fireball now the cool thing about stance cancelling is that when you're in stance you don't have to charge spinning bird kick or your fire balls they automatically charge all you have to do is just press the direction of the input you want to do so for spinning brick kick all you have to do is press down for Fireball all you have to do is press back what I like to do is hold down back so I get the charge for both moves so let's say I get the hits I can go into spinning bird kick if I do not get the hits I can go into a fireball now another thing you want to do when you practice your stance cancelling is you want to do a button and then stance cancel this will help you get very good so a couple of things that you can do to practice your stance cancel you can do heavy punch stance light kick into heavy Fireball or heavy punch into stance medium kick into heavy Fireball this will help you get better at your stance inputs trust me it does take time it might feel hard at first but as your hands and your brain and your mind muscle connection all get used to inputting button stance button trust me it gets a lot easier don't quit on this character just because you can't do stance it took me a long time trying to get this well maybe not a long time probably like a couple weeks but once you play the character for so long it'll be second nature so easy to do another note when you do stance heavy kick you can hold up while the heavy kick animation is in motion so stance heavy kick hold up you'll be able to jump cancel on immediately go up you don't have to press up after you can hold up or up forward I personally like to hold up forward another good thing about stance cancels is that most of the buttons are actually cancelable into di not all of them but most of them are stance light punch stance light kick stance medium kick and stance heavy punch these buttons are cancelable into di the ones that are not cancelable are stance medium punch and stance heavy kick this is very good because if you go to the block string where you end in Fireball it actually loses to di so if your opponent adapts to this you can instead cancel into Di now we're going to talk about her supers her level one level two and level three her level one is kind of normal it's just a regular special move it pushes your opponent super far back I would only use this if you need like a little bit more damage honestly I would go for level two the most I would try to save my meter more for level two or level three but if if you're one combo away from winning the round and your opponent just has a little bit of Health left I will go into level one now level two this is the Saucy combo you can go for more things out of level two whether your opponent is in the air or on the ground you will get access to different things out of level two if you end in this route you will get the most damage I also like ending in heavy spinning bird kick so you can also get a lot of corner carry as well also for that extra bit of sauce you can go for level one after level two now this is like I said a little bit flashy uh if you have a level three it will just be better to spend a level three you'll get more damage but like I said for cool reasons level two into level one also works so all of these routes work out of OD spinning bird kick or if your opponent's on the ground if your opponent is in the air and you land level two all you can do is like a heavy punch after I believe level three very simple I like to attack it to the end of combos it only gets scaled down to 50% so after a long driver extended combo I like to end in level three you want to be careful though because I do find that when you end in the safe jump route you have to delay it more so you can land your level three if you finish the safe jump route too high sometimes your level three will whiff so this is why I like to delay it when I know for sure I'm going to go into level three or another Super now we will be talking about Oki or followups I know a lot of people have trouble understanding what Oki is I do have videos on Oki check those out but here's what you can do as Chun let's say you land a combo all you really want to go for is standing medium punch and throw just mix those two things stand medium punch and throw reason why is because stand medium punch can hit mey and if it hits mey you will have additional frame Advantage but let's say you mess up the mey HIT stand medium punch is still plus one so you'll be able to continue your pressure also throw you want to mix in throw because if you're always doing standing medium punch they're just going to block and you're not going to be able to really get any pressure so you want to try to get them to throw on wake up and if they guess wrong you can landine your standing medium punch they block you can landine a throw so you want want to put them in that strike throw mix another route for Oki that you want to go for is going for the overhead if your opponent wakes up holding down back you'll clip them with the overhead and you'll be able to get a combo however there is inconsistency because sometimes standing medium punch will whiff to stop this inconsistency you don't want to automatically go into down forward heavy punch you want to have the slightest delay and press down forward heavy punch so you can get more consistent stand medium punch hits even if he does wake up jab you can throw him out of it with a meaty throw and if you want to practice these scenarios yourself all you have to do go to your settings come here to reversal settings and then select any one of these slots set it to light punch because these are are your fastest moves for most of the character it is a standing light punch and you're going to want to turn that on and boom so now on wake up they will Press light punch so that's how you can practice timing these scenarios you'll know you did it right if you see counter hit and you'll know you did it wrong if either you get counter hits or you get punish countered this is the thing about crouching heavy punch it's it's it's kind of risky a little bit risky but if you can get it to work you can get it to work crouching heavy punch has a lot more combo damage potential Chun doesn't really have trade combos which kind of sucks I kind of wish he did have trade combos but this is why using crouching heavy punch as hokei is a little bit risky if you space it out a little bit more you can set it up to be a frame trap and you'll get it to work that way so I had a little bit of a gap in my offense in order to set it up to hit mey and it was fine and the thing about getting a throw in the corner is you actually get Oki off the throw you don't get throw Oki midscreen because because midscreen if they back tech which most of your opponents will do they're just so far away but in the corner even if they back teack you're spaced far enough to get Oki so you can follow up that throw with a standing heavy punch something like that this is something I like to do a lot because people do tend to press because Chun has no true throw Loop people like to press buttons on wake up after the throw so that stand heavy punch it will clip them another thing you could do as well is crouching heavy punch it will also clip them now we're going to get to the fun stuff safe jumps this is part of the reason why Chun is so fun as a character so if you don't know what a safe jump is I will show you this is her first safe jump route and it's going to be jump stomp stomp or down medium kick down medium kick into heavy punch heavy punch which is a Target combo meaning you can mash it out down down heavy punch heavy punch and then boom you'll know you did it right if it is plus 45 see so this is plus 46 this is very important you want to get this consistently plus 45 Plus for 25 this is what you want this is safe jump setup the other two safe jumps that Chun has are done in the corner you'll know that she has a safe jump because it will be plus 45 if I do this it will be plus 45 or if I do this it'll be plus 45 heavy legs into light legs gives a safe jump or OD spinning bird kick into medium legs gives a safe Jump Plus 45 now if your opponent presses on wake up you can actually punish them and if they do a super or Invincible reversal on wake up you'll be able to block that and that will lead you to getting a punish combo so we're going to have Akuma do DP OD DP on wake up if if you do a safe jump you can actually beat this see I don't get hit if you do a regular combo and go for Oki you will get hit but with a safe jump you don't get hit so notice right there how I pressed the button when you are doing the jump out of your safe jump you want to hold down back so when you jump hold down back and you can hold down back while you press a button so for a safe jump you can hold back but for Chun I like to hold down back because I like to follow up with down medium kick and that gives you the stomp if you hold back you get regular medium kick so if you are out of the safe jump hold down back and press your stomp you'll be able to option select between blocking or getting the hit so let's say instead of an ODP Akuma does a jab you'll be able to counter hit him out of the jab and you'll get another turn you really want to practice her Launcher safe jump combo because it can either hit for plus 45 or plus 46 now if it hits when it's plus 35 Chun gets this little bounce that looks like this and you go towards your opponent but if your safe jump is plus 46 you will land on the ground after the stomp so I'll show you what it's like when it's plus 46 you do the Stomp and you immediately land on the ground but when you are plus 45 five you'll get the bounce which can lead into the jumping heavy kick so if you really want to grind that out I say do it it's 100% worth it cuz you want to know when you're going to get the bounce because you could end up doing the plus 46 route do your Stomp and then press stand heavy kick and then it whiffs and your opponent's crouching and then you get punish counted so it's you know you want to practice it being plus 45 you don't have to worry about grinding out the other safe jump setups because they automatically set up to be plus 45 for you automatically plus 45 automatically plus 45 but for your Launcher safe jump setup you really want to practice it being plus 45 or plus 46 you want it to be plus 45 I think the difference is when you do the stomp stomp I think that timing is what determines if you're going to get plus 45 or plus 46 I don't really know what exactly causes it to be plus 45 or plus 46 you can also do a side switch out of this safe jump all you have to do is delay your jumping heavy punch and then you'll be able to dash under the opponent for a side switch and I usually like to follow up with a standing medium punch so now that we understand how the safe jump works I'm going to show you all the mixups and things that you can do off of this plus 45 so first you can do jump nothing into throw if your opponent is blocking you get a free throw another thing you could do is jump into Crouch light kick empty jump Crouch light kick this will beat if they stand blocking if they think that you're going to hit them with the overhead or like a jump heavy kick or you can go into jumping heavy kick jump heavy kick is an overhead so if they wake up and hold down back you'll get an overhead and be able to convert from there so now your opponent's mix right they don't know if to block low they don't know if to block high they don't know if they're going to have to delay Tech but now you can utilize your stops as Chun like I said when she's plus 45 you get a stomp that bounces you towards your opponent so basically you can still do the three mixups just use a stomp first so you can go stomp into throw you can go stomp into crouching light kick you can go stomp into jumping heavy kick or you can go stomp stomp stomp so these are seven different setups you can get off of getting a safe jump this is why I say this character is so fun in the corner not only does she get that but you can do stance setups so if you get a safe jump you can do stance un stance throw and obviously this catches them if they block stance un stance Crouch light kick stance un stance stance medium punch and then you can do stance into heavy punch which is an overhead couple more set setups you can do you can do forward heavy kick into throw which has to be manually timed if you combo it together your throw will whiff or you can do forward heavy kick into standing medium punch all those are setups that you get off of being plus 45 with Chun your opponent has a guess crazy now some Corner setups that you get off of spinning bird kick is you can set up for the throw you can do frame kill frame kill Crouch light kick Crouch light punch into throw Crouch light kick Crouch light punch into stand medium punch Crouch medium kick into throw and Crouch medium kick into into standing medium punch a lot of times too out of stance buttons you can actually go for a DI reset on the wall in the corner and you can do a couple of things off of this wall Splat and they look like this she also has very good Crouch medium kick driv potential you can set up for something called a tick throw let's say that your opponent is blocking or playing very patiently and you want to start some pressure very quickly you can do Crouch medum kick Drive into tick th and it'll look like this now something players are adapting to is actually using a technique called delay Tech they're waiting to see you do a light button and then they'll delay the input for the throw because most of the time when you see a light button a throw has a high possibility of coming next there are two ways to beat a delay Tech one is if you're going to go into dri light you can go into standing medium punch and convert into a combo another thing you can do is Crush medium kick dver straight into the [Music] throw so once you condition them to throw immediately after they see you drive rush you can set up for this route note that if you go for this you can either start your combo with Drive Rush crouching heavy Punch or back heavy punch and you don't need to drive rush if you don't want to to spend all the drive meter you can also just end in heavy spinning bird kick if you don't Dy Rush your back heavy punch you'll have to end intentio because spinning bird will not work but if you use a dush you can end in heavy spinning bird kick your goto Drive reversal combo will be this right here a very good button to check a drive Rush is crouching medium punch sometimes I also try to go for Jabs but I notice that I get counter hit out of them I feel like crouching medium punch is just a way better button to check driver rushes with now like I said so sauce this is going to be the Saucy portion of the video if you want to show off and you want to flex a little bit you can do these setups but note you can get beat out of these setups if your opponent presses jab they might be able to beat you out of some of these setups just so you know so you want to make sure that you have their respect and that they're actually blocking because if they're just pressing buttons just to press you'll get hit out of some of these something that I like to do is when I get a combo right a big combo you can go for an overhead reset because most of the time when people are blocking they're holding down back so if they're holding down back mid combo you can go for stance heavy punch and you'll hit them with an overhead because they're holding down back mid combo so you can get another combo off of that overhead another thing you can do is button stance un stance as people have fought against Chun over time and got better versus J they understand that after heavy punch you can press and it'll beat The Stance light kick so the counter Cate to that is to do stand heavy punch stance un stance wait for them to press and then you can whiff punish them with like a Ford medium punch or something Crouch medium kick next is instant air legs I like this one a lot if your opponent wakes up and they think that you're going to throw you can do instant air legs it will beat their throw and you'll be able to get a punish counter combo another thing that trun players do that I myself don't really do too much but I know it's Tech it's an instant stomp side switch so what you do is you have to be really close to your opponents and you jump immediately do Stomp and you can do medium kick and this will side switch so if they don't block immediately they'll get hit and that will convert you into a combo something I do like to do though is down forward heavy kick so this works I like to use it after Oki maybe like spinning B kick combo I use it I go to my opponent down forward heavy kick gives me a side switch so if they're not able to react to this you can actually get a combo off of this however do know if you do this a lot they'll get used to seeing the animation and they'll start blocking it more so that's that's why you really have to mix up your Oki pressure now at this point in the video I'll be showing you guys some block strings and combos that you might want to do and learn and add to your Arsenal as a Chun player if you guys like this video like I said all I ask is like and a sub I also stream almost every day on Twitch so if you're interested feel free to head over there and drop me a follow but yeah I hope you enjoy this next portion of the video peace for
