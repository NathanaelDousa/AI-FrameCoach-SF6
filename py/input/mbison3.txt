so for this guide I want to do kind of the same thing I did with Marissa where it was first like a beginner Guide to the character kind of an introduction more of like if you're picking up bison what's the what are the cliff notes the tldr like I don't just skip the fluff how do I play this character what do I want to learn what do I want to focus on I think with bison it's important to understand like your wi condition and like what your strengths and weaknesses are as a character he is really good in mid-range phenomenal mid-range this range right here he excels at it he obviously has scissors kick to apply pressure here stand medium kick s heavy punch and obviously dry brush his dry brush is insane we'll talk a bit more about that but essentially he dominates this range he has he's really good against projectiles with Ex Psycho [Music] since it's it's safe on block and you're out of throw range if they block it so you can kind of just randomly throw it out you're not going to be able to react to Fireballs from this range but it's still if you're going off on a read you can just throw it out and if you're wrong fine you're safe if your opponent throws a fireball or if they do literally anything like if they press random [ __ ] but if they walk forward they're getting clipped so very strong here he doesn't his anti-air is decent crouching heavy punch is good but it has limited horizontal range so Mt jumps can kind of cook it from certain ranges and he but he does have light punch psycho and Ex Psycho to antiair but they require charge so it's it can be a little awkward to antiair with him but if you're used to playing characters with like Crouch heavy punch anti-air he'll be an easy pickup he has no reversal so you have to use assistant Mechanics for defense perfect Parry no back dash challenge with jab I think those are his main weaknesses is like his anti-air and his defense but his Pros are I think make up for it by quite a bit outside of his neutral control I think he has some of the most explosive offense in the game he just needs one touch and he can snowball from there like his snowball potential is really high if he gets heavy bomb which is his best combo starter or combo Ender um his oky options from this are ridiculous like you can get needies you can get overheads you can get throw shimmy I mean you got the entire your entire offensive options from there um they all beat wake up jab or wake up buttons like all your your options on knockdown are real and if your opponent guesses wrong if they do anything except take throw and you guess correctly you probably wion the game summarize his offense to that degree and his Corner pressure is top tier if he has you in the corner he's going to keep you in the corner and back heavy kick being Plus on block s heavy punch being Plus on block like he has a lot of options to to really start punishing your drve gauge now a few things that you really want to focus on with this character is understanding the your ranges you want to play usually around stand medium kick range like right outside of it he has really good walk speed so you can close a gap really well if your opponent is walking back and from this range you can bait wh punishers as well you can bait out a lot of normals and and whiff punish him from there his whiff punishes will almost exclusively end in um heavy bomb and this is where I want you guys to really understand I see a lot of Bison that go for shitty combos or maybe more damaging combos but they end in like medium bomb or light bomb you should always end in heavy bomb unless you get like there's some Fringe cases where maybe you get like a counter hit scissors you know from here you can do like stand like kick and light bomb that's fine fine um but if you have the option to go for heavy bomb always go for heavy bomb [Music] now going over a few routes with the character you know outside of just standard combo routes I want to go over Oki options as well like the the options you should lab with them so his combos if you land a hit with a medium you should almost always go for stand medium crouching heavy into heavy [Music] bomb this will be your best option from low from Crouching medium kick from Crouching medium punch you got a few more options I I keep it the same just for muscle memory and for my mental sack but if you want to optimize you can go for back heavy kick and to stand medium punch heavy bomb if you let him a CR a medium punch after heavy bomb like his his combo options aren't really that deep if they don't have a bomb on them they they do flesh out once you have a bomb on them cuz there's several routes you can go through um but before that your main goal is just to land bomb sometimes you you will have meter to spend and you'll land like a whiff punish or like a stand medium punch usually if you have a lot of meter you want to go for ex scissor kick because this gives you bomb this gives you heavy bomb and a bit of corner carry as well if you see where they start off just for three bars cuz you spend the third bar here you it's half screen carry so it's really good and obviously that followup if you guess right there you know they take 4K damage and they're in the corner now what's the difference in heavy bomb and medium bomb so the difference is the Oki heavy bomb gives you way more frame advantage that's plus 31 light bomb and medium bomb give you a lot less so that's plus 24 that's plus 23 the problem with that is you don't really get real Oki options I mean you obviously you still do get some Oki but you don't you don't get your entire kit you for example you can't driver or throw someone and beat buttons if you land light or medium bomb like this isn't a real option you'll always [Music] lose so you you have to go for some other [ __ ] that's riskier like low forward into heavy bomb which is a good option but it's not the most damaging essentially your options are limited you can't you don't have like a a consistent meaty against them um you you can't punish punish wake up Perry as well without going for a hard read so there it's just your options are just way more limited as opposed to heavy bomb heavy bomb you always get driver throw this is free you always get Drive rush back heavy pick as a combo or as a Mei and your combo options from heavy bomb from your Bey from heavy bomb are way more damaging you you also get driver Rush overhead they can't wake up buttons against that this is [Music] guaranteed it's jehra the fake Mees yeah bro I when I play against bison they all do some suboptimal [ __ ] skidy ass Combos and it just makes my blood boil so essentially heavy bomb that's your priority your only goal here in neutral is figure out a way to land heavy bomb whether it you know get a whiff punish or low forward whatever the case is you want heavy bomb now your options after heavy bomb I detailed a few of them right so you get Drive rush through this is manually timed so you want to learn how to do this drive rush back heavy kick as well it's also manually timed you could [ __ ] up the timing so make sure you learn it and dry brush overhead it's instant you just drive brush it's the easiest one actually you just drive brush as soon as you turn green you just press forward Hard Punch and you'll get it all the time so you have to be brave to push buttons after getting cycle mind not exactly if I get hit by light bomb I'm not scared of waking a buttons I'm not scared of [ __ ] waking up di because if they go for this [ __ ] that loses to di so it's again it's kind of gimmicky your options after light bomb and medium bomb are gimmicky you don't get anything concrete is draw rush into scissors to be Jazz um yeah this is ass though cuz it also loses to di what I want to tell you guys is after light bomb or medium bomb wake up di is a legit option if you're playing against bison and you get hit by light bomb and you'll know when it's light bomb because they'll get it from like crouching medium Punch or Jabs right or crouching medium kick you you'll know if it's light bomb don't be afraid of of waking up the eye cuz it beats like the vast majority of his options it's hard for him to actually punish it so heavy bomb is a priority you have several options from it where of the routes there are a few you can go through so if you have a lot lot of meter and you're wanting to go for the kill essentially you want to go for um yeah cycle [Music] Crusher ex cycle Crusher is going to give you the most damage but it's the the most expensive one cuz you need meter for both The Ex Psycho and the ex stomp but obviously you got a fuckload of damage so that's for the kill if you're not going to kill and you just want the corner carry plus bomb there are other options you can go for ex scissors into scissors that gives you a fuckload of corner carry and it gives you another bomb this combo will require some time labed though in particular the head stomp portion that one's a bit more difficult so if you land a hit from a mey back heavy kick instead of going for Ex Psycho you go stand medium Crouch medium ex scissors into heavy scissors that's perfectly timed so that they'll explode midair and that's what you need for the heavy stomp to connect so again this stand medium Crouch medium and then the ex oh wait forgot it [Music] oh heavy scissors the key to that so that part is very droppable after the head stomp that part is very droppable the key to it is once you land the head some you move forward a little bit and then press Punch If you don't move forward you're going to drop [Music] it it's a tiny little movement it's a micro adjustment forward after you land that light Plum and up with whatever C you want now what if you have him in the corner what are the options here this is where he excels so this is where light medium and heavy bombs are all good you don't care which one you go for because they they all give you guaranteed Mees actually light and medium bomb both have um safer Mees than heavy bomb so for let's start off with heavy bomb heavy bomb you do get a pretty sick mey that that gives you an instant throw situation but it is Drive reversible though so Dash up back heavy kick is perfectly timed you're plus four on block which means that you get a guaranteed throw afterwards and this is a safe throw too because if your opponent back dashes they um they cannot punish you you're minus three after that you're minus three so they can't punish your so really good post throw situation obviously you also get a shimmy from that you have enough time to walk back and punish a throw and since you're walking back you have back charge so teching there is terrible you have to take the throw right well taking the throw leaves you into Layer Two of this mixup cuz now that whole sequence it killed off a lot of time on the bomb so you get a a high low essentially you could go for like an instant overhead or like a slightly delayed crouching um medium kick your opponent like the bomb will detonate as your hit is ending and you'll get a combo from that so taking a throw during this situation is still not good for your opponent you know they right here you can go for overhead or low forward I like going for low forward into light scissors cuz I'm plus 14 after that even if you block it so plus 14 means I get dry Rush pressure I get walkup pressure I mean it's plus [ __ ] 14 bro that's double digits on overhead on block you're plus 23 so you can do some dumb [ __ ] that's enough frame advantage to go for something like that so that's if they block it what if they don't block it bu they that's a GG shake my [Music] hand that's 60% gone because we didn't block the overhead and I mean we can say the same for you guys get it in the corner I'm taking two throws you're not doing to You're So Okay so that is actually the best thing to do is after this you carry and take the throw but that's a problem right you're going to take a punish counter throw and you're still in the corner you don't have a bomb on you but you're still in the corner and you're almost dead like you're essentially at next guess like guess for game so taking two throws is still [ __ ] risky this is why I say that bison his offense is one of the most explosive in the game there's just no good answer it's you're guessing and if you guess wrong it's high it's you explode throw is going to do the least amount of damage how many of those are you going to take so that's heavy right to summarize heavy bomb Dash up knee if this hits actually I didn't go over it don't hit if it hits you're plus seven and you got some cool combos you got some cool combos from that you could go for that or ex cycle Crusher I mean I'm not going to [ __ ] demonstrate all of them all right let's go over light and medium they both have very similar oi so there's going to be overlap the only difference medium gives you like overhead and it's a mey overhead it's perfectly timed so you can do some you know you can combo from that but that's some day one bison [ __ ] everybody knows to look out for the overhead and if they block the overhead um you're actually minus one so it's not even your turn it's not worth it there's better options than that honestly the better option with Stan light kick into stand medium punch so the reason this is really good is it's meaty as [ __ ] first of all this meat as [ __ ] that's plus eight not that it matters but you can be chill with that um on block you're plus two the best part about it why I mention that this Oki option is actually safer than heavy bomb is because you don't lose the drive reversal this is safe from Drive reversal and if they drive reversal while they have a bomb they die so Drive reversal is out of the question the problem with this if they block this isn't real they could actually trade if they um block that sand medum punch [Music] so if you see that that stand medium punch is blocked and you want to punish buttons you have to go for a different option you can't autopilot the crouching medium punch you have to go for stand light kick stand jab and then from there go do whatever [ __ ] you want to yeah keep up the pressure there there are several options you you go from there but don't autop fil into Crouch and meum punch cuz people will Mash another option to beat Mash actually is just delay if you just delay you'll catch through mash and for combos it's going to be pretty similar to the one of the for the heavy punch if you want to conserve your meter go for this route [Music] and you get put in the same situation or if you want to go for the kill just go for [Music] exi now what if they take the throw here if they take the throw in this situation you don't get like an auto timed 50/50 for the bomb detonation you have to delay it a little bit so if you take if you go for this throw you you can't just overhead and have the bombb explode right after you have to like walk up all your combo but you have to delay it a little bit so that this posto situation is much worse than the heavy bomb version which is right here is where the opponent should theoretically take two throws because if they take the first throw they're not in real danger of dying to a 50/50 right afterwards like they can take that throw and then take the other throw but if your opponent is in that mindset where they're willing to take that throw they're giving you time to set up that that 50/50 right so that's when you can for sh like that and it has to be Target combo you have to start it off with stand medium punch in order to Auto time it your opponent can just Parry the followup so this is where you start doing other [ __ ] you start layering it medium punch into throw it's really strong this will work against better players if they want to Parry the the followup I didn't really go over all of his tools honestly like this move I feel like it's pretty self-explanatory just don't kill yourself using it a lot of Bic especially like lowle bison they're depending on this move because other lower level players don't know how to deal with it but if you're depending on that move as a crutch you're going to get cooked man just don't learn how to walk and press s medium kick with this character learn how to walk and use like max range light kick scissors like don't kill yourself you don't have to you don't have to force the issue you just need one hit that's that should be in the back of your mind you need one hit into heavy bomb and from there you can win
