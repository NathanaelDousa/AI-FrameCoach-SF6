sonic boom sonic boom sonic boom shooting i made some labbing and wanted to point out some major things regarding the season 3 changes if you missed the balance changes for Gile I will link that video below i will also make a video of some of the cool stuff other players have found for season 3 hopefully by tomorrow but let's dive into this video for today by the changes for standing heavy kick it's now possible to hit confirm a dry brush standing hard kick and also a punish counter into sonic hurricane there could be some situations where nothing else could reach for this additional damage the higher damaging routes from the standing heavy kick has been changed due to this button so here are some other basic adjustments to amp up the damage again [Music] [Music] these were some other options that you can do the meter gain from starting with forward heavy punch could be a good thing if you feel that it's a hard to too hard to time this button correctly use the sobat instead i tried around the post flat combo more and it's truly buff now combined with the sonic hurricane in season 2 there were no way this would land it would always whiff but now it's super solid and this combo might be a way to get the space back after the changes to basukani for around 4,000 damage this can be a good way to close around even without a sonic hurricane it's possible to follow up but I only suggest this if it will kill because five drive gauges for this combo might be too expensive the buffed down forward hard kick on punishing counter will be a great with punishing monster tool now from the changes learn how to chimmy with it for great punish rewards heat heat [Music] [Music] basukani got nerfed to the ground and Gal cannot side switch with it any longer i will show some ways to adjust our DI defense for a bit better positioning and resource changes all these were possible before but might even be more important now this is the highest meterless damage 2,740 damage the drive gauge we got back was around half a bar and we landed here from this combo with adjustments we will get more meter and more space away from the corner for a little less damage with an easy adjustment [Music] forward hard punch combined with the three hit combo did 2,690 damage around 25% more drive gauge back and we landed here this might not seem as much but now we are forced to find new ways for better positioning on the stage the good part around this is that we can create pressure after i have a guide around the topic in the comments if you want to create damage opportunities after a flash kick ender this option could also be a good thing to pull off dash forward after the drive impact into a sweep target combo flash kick less damage less drive gauge but a little bit more space away from the corner what option you choose to go for is up to you just remember that position is sometimes more worth than damage [Applause] it took around 2 minutes then people had found a new way to side switch this cost one drive gauge but could be worth it after hard sonic hurricane drive rush and input forward hard kick this will end up being around plus 9 so if they wake up in place you can meet and mix them up from this otherwise they will roll into the corner this setup is always effective if they try to block it feels like Y should side switch but will never do i made some labbing here and while it now we're guaranteed if they recover backwards from this this setup seems to whiff all wake up DPS but if they recover in place they will be able to hit you so be aware all that might not be uh 100% but sometimes very specific [Music] these were some of the stuff I wanted to talk about today i will make a compiled community video probably up by tomorrow people have found some crazy things already around the season 3 changes um so make sure to look for it if you want to support me please leave a like and comment below your first impressions of season 3 if you're new and interested in Gile consider subscribe and join up in the Discord for questions and sharing Gile stuff i hope you will have a great weekend and as always shooty [Music]
