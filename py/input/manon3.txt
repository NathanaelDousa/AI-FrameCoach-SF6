[Music] what's up guys we are back we are here with a new YouTube video today we're going over the five things you guys are doing wrong with Manan now there's so many little intricate things that this character has and right now I'm going to show you guys everything wrong you guys are doing right now so let's get started all right the first thing I feel like people are doing wrong with this character I see a lot of people in my YouTube comments for some reason saying this character needs an air throw while I'm always welcome to having more moves I do not think you need an air throw because uh you're going to get a medal anyway if you just do hold on EX upkick into spin you get a metal anyway I feel like more people aren't using this anti-air tool because it is a free metal and also does decent damage if like you actually do land in anti-air so I feel like if you want to build your medals early on in the round doing ex up kcks to anti-air to store free medal well always you know be positive The Next Step that I also say that people don't really take advantage of and I may be wrong on this don't quote me on this I feel like Manan has the best five frame punish in the game so she actually gets to punish a lot of things that people usually don't get to punish like DJ's heavy kick as soon as I get it like that so you can kind of get good punish es depending on your range and spacing on certain normals like that you can force a mix up as well uh you can just get the sliding knockdown if you're close enough so I feel like her stand light kick is very good at punishing certain moves that are netive five so you know go into uh go into training mode unlike I do and figure out what moves are really good to punish with Manon stand light kick uh I know Jamie's Palm DJ's heavy kick uh Ken stand medium kicks another really good one I know a lot of people usually don't punish stand Ken stand medium kick but I know Ken stand medium kick I think is minus five Ken stand medium kicks minus five so you can also punish that a lot of the time so yeah utilize um a non-stand light kick I feel like it's one of the best light buffers in the game and like it can punish a lot of things uh buffer your lights I feel like people don't really do that so before in Street Fighter 5 I there's like the most common spacing traps is with like G and stuff if you're at a range and you feel like your opponent really can't harass except for with like a really you know far range button like Luke stand heavy punch in this scenario or like say I do this well this move is very minor but uh if you do like stand heavy punch you can always kind of like buffer your light like it's kind of oh let me move my screen so you guys can actually see when I do my light buttons usually I'm buffered behind it kind of like this so if you guys look at my uh my notations you guys see my quarter Circle forward heavy kick does never comes out but if I do it on loot it comes out so I feel like buffering your lights is really strong just like strong you know fighting game tool in general buffering your uh buffering your moves behind your specials really strong uh number four utilizing back heavy punch hit confirms because I feel like it is it's super important when you're trying to make the push from like Master to like 1,700 Mr but being good at hit confirming back heavy punch is super strong I feel one of the best things I can recommend go to training mode put your opponent to set to random block and then kind of just practice hit confirming this because this is super important it's it very lenient window uh if to me I feel like it's one of the easier hit confirms as well uh even from playing Street Fighter 5 and learning how to hit confirm is super important so just even getting like easy combos or easy you know damage like that is super important with Manan as well and the final thing I can say is managing your opponent's Drive meter that's the that's the key one now I I always say this I feel like Manan is one of the best character in the game at harassing your opponent's Drive meter not cuz she doesn't have any safe specials to really do on Block but I feel like if your opponent gets to like a certain space like here in Drive meter you you're really you really do feel free to harass if you have enough Health obviously to kind of just harass and poke at them to like keep their Drive meter always in danger her stand heavy punch is really good at draining Drive meter your stand heavy kick is really good at keeping your opponent's Drive meter down uh one thing I like to do as well so like if I have if I see my opponent's Drive meters like here I'll intentionally do the target combo on block to just drain zap the drive meter if I get punished in there and burn out there punishes aren't that great unless they have like super or something so usually I'll I'll try to harass with manan's really good heavy buttons to kind of drain my opponent's Drive meter a lot uh another good string to do is if you can get like back heavy punch back heavy punch into overhead that takes like a drive meter and a half or you can do bop bop ex overhead zaper Drive meter they lost two Drive meters off of pure block string so I feel like uh managing your opponent's Drive meter with manan's kind of specials and super I mean yeah special moves and like her really good heavy is really good and making sure uh they never really have Drive meter to harass you with uh let me know if you guys enjoyed the video let me know if you guys want to see more content like this cuz you know doing videos like this helps me let lets you guys know my mindset when I'm playing and I will see you guys next video peace
