Ed the mid to long range tricky type style character this character comes with a lot to offer and he is not easy to play but a very common question that I get asked a lot Nightmare how do I play Ed how do you go about learning the character so in today's video I'm going to be showing mother lovers how to throw these hands break it down from the normals to specials more and more and more and more so you already know what time it is hey yo at a man let's get it man all right y'all so first things first add is a tricky style character meaning he got pump fakes he got back steps he got shills he got five balls he got DP he got a whole arsenal to play around with depending on who you're going against and how you want to approach the match up depending on who you fighting his effective range is definitely going to be M to long range cuz he has Flicker and also the fireballs and east of use he is hard this character is not a pick up and go I'm letting you know that now so if you think that it is going to be the type of character that you want to play just to get an easy win you got another thing coming I'm going let you know that right now so yeah all right y'all so diving straight into the action let's go ahead and talk about the normal starting off with standing jab so in most situations Jabs normally extend straight out to cover a good range in its case his actually reaches out a little bit and points upwards so long story short it's not that good if you if you think about it right if you look at a jab like DJ Akuma Ryu Ken you know a jab that goes you know what I'm saying straight out right you look at at a jab like this that's a good jab you know it covers quick range it's a full frame startup so it's going to cover distance real quick now look at a jab like that your dig it ain't you know what I'm saying it ain't really doing too much D it's like it's going to be a little stubby if you ask me okay so it's good up close but you definitely don't want to rely on it too much if you're asking me right so like I said it's a four it's a 4frame startup so if you come across a punishment that's -4 and is up close of course you can start off with this and get your proper punish going uh same thing with crouching light punch it doesn't cover distance how you would want it to cover right not that good so long story short is Jabs are not the best right I wouldn't rely on it too much but they have they play but yeah I I no okay crouching light kick this light is definitely good it's one of his flickers and it covers pretty good range at a straight angle so this this is a good quick poke only thing is is one frame slower compared to his other Jabs where it being a five Fram start up of course if it leads into a counter hit you could get double crouching light into medium DP right or you can even get double crouching light into medium Blitz and knock down but we're going to get into that a little bit later on standing medium punch seven frames start up negative one on block so due to the range it's decent but you have better options right long story short why press standing medium punch when you could be pressing standing medium kick right more range more bang for your buck and of course you could do medium into light flicker better poke options compared to getting a little bit closer and then go for that now standard medium also goes into the target combo right which is a good mind game because if you spaced it to a range to where you throw the shield out and they try and Jab you know they can get count hit confirm into a followup so standard medium definitely has good openers if they respect the target combo so just imagine you know doing this or doing this into that and they respecting it right so if you get them looking for that enough you can start opening up options like standing medium into crouching medium punch now of course this is a Ste term because you know standing medium is negative one on block and you lead into a eight frame crouching medium punch so you're still in the turn but it's forcing respect because they're looking for the Target combo followup so it's all about mind games and opening up your options in order for something else to work so standing media punch is good decent and okay all at the same time but you definitely have better options that Ed has in this kit right so standing Fierce is going to be the next button this button is real good it's a 10 frame start up negative2 oh block but there's a main reason why this is good I don't want to talk about that standing Fierce and to life flicker is a true to string right meaning if they decide to think that they're going to be able to drive impact this situation they cannot so I'm going to do that boom boom it won't work it's a true strength now if you do something that's fake with a gap the computer would have be able to drive pack the drive impact in the middle of it but since n infer into life flicker is a true situation this is a true poke this is going to be a free way to bully the drive gauge right so they have to drive impact the actual Fair and catch you fully committ to the flicker in order for that to get Drive Impact but that's more of a hard read that's a i that that's a I feel you about to do something that I should be able to drive impact right so that's a hard commitment right there so stay FS is a strong strong option right it's you can also hit confirm options so say you do I'm going goe and set see you can also hit confirm it so whichever option that you feel more comfortable with off for hit confirming this is also another option I'm I'm kind of Booty at it I'm trying to get better but it's possible and of course once you get them respecting you know stand Affairs into life flicker you're able to do you can hold te the options which pulls them in for plus four you could fears into back step if you feel like they're going to try and drive impact you could te the charge in the back step and still look to bait di like these are all options that stand first allow you to do so stand f is going to be a main tool that Ed must use in this kit it allows for True bully strings it allows for disrespectful strains that allow you to charge into plus four setups and back step when you feel like they want to di you and of course you can do stand FS into heavy charge teder if you think they're going to jump so this is the part where I say Ed is not a pick up and go character because understanding and taking notes of what your opponent is doing how they reacting is going to play a big part if you're going to be good with it or if you're going to be bad with it I I just got to keep it a bug 1000 with y'all this character is not easy he got a lot to offer but moving on go to poke in neutral when I say this is your go-to poke this is your go to poke this is your rad and butter this is this button is amazing right look at the range on it look at the range on it it's ne5 it's a 10 frame start up and of course it's special counselor so you can do medium kick and a life flicker you can do medium kick driver Rush same thing I was saying off the Stander you could do te the charge in the backstep if you feel like they're going to drive impact or commit to something you can hit for that so if if you see the standing medium kick hit into the flicker you can buff a level three right off of that then get you some good damage off that you know what I'm saying it's time to line I smile for the cam while up there it also has a tar combo offing the target combo for the second hit followup is actually ne6 on block so if you space it correctly it cannot get punished so if you see that both hits connect off the hi airm you can follow with a heavy punch lead which leads into a knockdown um crouching medium kick another good button another good amazing button it's a nine frame startup and it whiffs on crouches right at of range it will whiff but up close it'll actually hit a crouching mother Lev and it's negative one on block but let me explain you why this button is so good it comes with so much reward and of did you hear what I said ad it come with so much reward you cannot go wrong with this button you have to use this button also you know what I'm saying on regular normal hit it is plus eight meaning meaning you can follow up with Crossing medium punch naturally in my case I like to use standing medium punch which leads into the target combo boom boom boom it's a heavy Blitz you know what I'm saying plus far2 the wake up you get a kill Rush forward for some Oki I'm going to talk about that a little bit later on in the video you know pressure Oki knock down all that but standing M kick is amazing it whiffs on crouches like I said but you know people like to move back and forth in neutral right so this is where it comes in strong at so like I said imagine this Lucas moving back and forth and then you just you know what I'm saying you just smack him real quick you dig what I'm saying and do you he did plus 11 on counter hit plus 11 on counter hit you can now get a standing Fierce followup into more damage so get the knock down uh uh uh uh uh uh you know what I'm saying crouching me kick is a must use button also it offers a lot and another thing that like to do sometimes at a certain range say you whiff one you know some some people like to try and whiff punish you for whiffing but sometimes they miss so in the process of them missing you press the button again and then you'll catch them for missing you you know what I'm saying so it's like a game of tag you know what I'm saying they trying to punish you for whiffing but then they whiff so you catch the counter hereit for them whiffing and then you lead into more big damage you day what I'm saying so at this range you you whiff one and then you press another one nine times out of 10 I promise you they will get hit his flick options are all good cuz they all cover amazing range e even his standing light kick look at the range that it covers it's -3 can't be punished even up close cuz the fastest button in the game is four frames so add a range you can do this into a crouching light if they whiff something they got a two-piece follow up to this which is also -3 you can hit confirm this so if you see the first first two hit you could lead into that but be careful it's ne8 on block so you want to make sure that it actually hits crouching roundhouse yeah this button is also very good it actually covers a little bit more range than standing medium kick so standing medium kick is about right here so at that range that this will actually miss if I backstep just a little bit you can actually get crouching roundhouse this button is real good negative4 can't be punished cuz of the spacing and of course you could do the same mind games as you could do with standing Med kick and standing FS right back step off it you can flicker off it and of course you can dry rush off it so like I said previously Mind Games Mind Games Mind Games Ed is a midrange control character that optimizes that making people well forcing people to mess up and fully capitalizing often so another normal that I actually want to talk about and it's actually a jump normal I wasn't really going to cover jump options cuz you know you only want to jump if you feel like uh you could jump in then get a combo started normally how you would off the ground but a jump option that I definitely want to talk about is jumping medium kick right this button is a lifesaver you can't go wrong with it whenever you feel like somebody's about to do something and they get hit by it so normally when you jump at somebody they have a habit of wan to move forward press a button or even go to antiair you right which is the kind of thing that you want want to do when somebody jumps at you but in Ed's case when you do jumping medium kick this will actually catch somebody you know trying to commit to something and hit them with this button right this this was smack so many people all a players y'all already know what I'm talking about this mother loving button will smack so many people and it's not even funny so once they get smacked you can lead into a free cross medum kick ex Snatcher light DP into heavy Blitz for a knockdown trust me y'all if you're playing a and you're not using this use it trust me you will smack a lot of people up thank me later all right y'all so let's go ahead and talk about his specials The Shield L and Fireball so same thing from Street Fighter 5 you know Ed has a two-step process to his projectiles the first one is a shield which actually helps him combat zoning so so he's going to throw a fireball I'm going throw a shield this is Ed's way of anti- zoning oops this is his way of anti zoning and in the process of you doing that you're able to throw your own projectile back in some cases you could throw ex get two off it allows for air to absorb two hits which basically means that EX for ex will cancel out with shield into their Fireball and then you can follow with your Fireball and still contest The anti- Zone and even if you want to just contest The Zone with the shield and then throw your slow Fireball this will cover the same thing where you're able to kill Rush forward close the gap and get in the space where you want to be at which is normally you know midrange and a little bit further back where you can hit with and of course light shield and shield in general has other purposes also this into that this is a plus three setup so Shield also has mey setups in the corner and Meaty Shield is going to be real strong because it allows you to beat wake up level one beat the fact that they want to try and press a button and allow you to follow up you don't always have to do this when you see a fireball coming at you you could sometimes throw this out and just get them to want to do something cuz in this situation when you do this people have a habit of wanting to jump because they feel like the followup is going to come after that which is the fireball so if you do the shield by itself with no followup you could actually start looking for the jump so I'm going to go ahead and do record that ENT that and just block I'm going to go ahead and play that just just like that right thr shell out DP thr shell out DP easy easy it's it's it's such a common situation where you throw Shield out and people just want to jump it's understandable because they're looking for the fireball setup but that's part of the Mind Game right don't throw the fireball look for the jump boom punish him get the knockdown get your pressure started right winning that street figh all right let's go ahead and talk a little bit about his flicker now flicker flicker flicker this is why Ed is a mid to long range character because at these ranges he can poke with flickers so if you're not within range of standing medium kick or even crouching Roundhouse at this range you could do light flicker even at this range right here you could do medium flicker you have mind games off the flicker options which is the back step you can even four step off it like like I said earlier this is the part where I say it is not easy to play because you have to have a read on your opponent you know sometimes if you holding medium flicker right like I'm doing right now if I'm holding medium Flicker and they don't jump you got to realize that they're jumping and either back step in order to get get away from the jump attack or dashing under them to get away realizing what's going on reacting to situations and plan it into what they struggle against or what you realize that they are allowing to have happen so you know quick game plan if you're going against somebody that's playing like heavy he heavy on the offense you know kind of getting in in your face all the time all the time you know not being afraid to show Drive Impact then you might want to play a little bit more button heavy dry rushing and just playing with your normals versus commit to flickers right because you don't want to get hit with that straight drive imp pack and then you just got hit now you about to get knocked down and then guessing for game right maybe you want to do back steps in the Mind Games and then bait out the drive imp pack and then drive imp pack them back so when they show you that option that you're looking for you got to be ready to punish accordingly cuz they did what you wanted them to do so basically with all that being said this is what ties into eded being hard to play right if you make any wrong commitment a guess you're most likely going to die for it and his DP is a 10 frame start up the traditional DP in this game is five frames so A's DP is five frames slower so it's not reliable but it's able to work if you have the reactions for it of course you have heavy kick for anti-air option you have hard to medum kick for the mid to long range antire option and you know DP for the traditional answer medium DP for that fer out jump like from the mid-range and heavy DP for that long range jump where they try and like close the gap and they don't feel like you're going to have the proper read like I said it's going to always be very strong and important when playing this character ad uh let's go ahe and talk about the blitz a little bit Blitz Blitz Blitz Blitz Blitz blitz so it leaves you plus three in their face yes plus three in their face it doesn't leave you close enough for a throw but of course you can do a light micro step and force that strike though mix same medium Blitz this is going to be your traditional way to end a combo if you end it with like a light strength Oops I did not mean to activate level two boom boom boom right that's going to be the way you end combos off of lights and heavy Blitz and then most traditional combos so this is like your bread and butter M scream which is you know standing fears ex licker light DP heavy Blitz plus 41 off the knockdown in this situation you can do kill Rush forward and become plus 10 on the dash up leave leaves you point blank so you can throw in this situation you can apply pressure with Jabs you could tap the feet in case they try and up back you can poke wants into a throw you know options all right y'all so we then covered normals specials let's go ahead and talk a little bit about pressure Oki and knock down so I tapped into this a little bit from the specials uh segment of this video but let's go ahead and dive a little bit deeper right Ed he wants to sit at that mid-range so his pressure is going to be heavily riing on pokes so poking with flickers medium flickers you know throwing Fireballs if you feel like they won't you know get disrespectful with a jump in not really showing you driv impacts so of course Fireballs is going to be good I don't really rely on Fireballs too much to really poke with because it's a two-step process so if you decide to commit to this after the shield and they see that and they jump on you and you commit to the fireball you will get punished so it's faster to throw a Flicker and if they sitting at that mid-range and they're not doing nothing well guess what it's time to pull you in for plus4 and start my pressure that way pull is plus4 y'all so this is something that I want to talk about and make sure that y'all really do understand it's plus4 meaning you could get a four frame jab and it's going to be a true jail meaning they cannot level one they cannot DP they cannot do nothing it's it's a real trap so let me go ahead and show you what I mean by that OD Rising uppercut off the block going jab boom that DP would have worked if I would have did a normal that was slower than a fullframe start up so if I would have did stand in medium I would have got beat if I would have did CAU and light I would have got beat but I'm doing standing light punch it's a true jail they can't do anded has a good dve rush but me personally I'm still working on trying to find ways to incorporate it because I like to sit at that mid-range with him and just pull with the options and then pull him in and play my games and force them to do what I want them to do so you know this is Street five six so never feel bad about dry rushing but finding ways to incorporate that is also going to be good so dry Rush jab pushes you in for plus three start the pressure with that standing medium punch is going to be actually really good after the driveway jab because it forces a trade which it should plus three standing medium is a seven frame so yeah it's going to trade with a four frame so I'm going to go ahead and do normal attacks crouching light punch that yeah and you're going to get a trade situation right here because on that exact frame is going to be trading with a foref frame exactly how plus am I in this situation off that trade I'm plus eight so I can get Med punch actually yeah get cross me punch to that so yeah y'all pressure is pretty ideal with it revolving around snatcher mixes you know but sometimes you might end up in a situation where you're scared to throw flickers right so poking with standing M kick oops well actually yeah poking whip stand minum kick getting that drive Rush crossum punch in all right y'all so let's go ahead and talk about Oki and knock down so Ed is really good mid stream mid scream and M opinion he has specials that follow up well that combo offer lights and that leads him to kill Rush forward which leaves him Point Blank for any mix so the reason why is kill Rush is good in this game he has something that a lot of characters don't have most characters in in this game after they get knocked down they have to apply pressure off wake up leading off a drive Rush which makes them have to spend meter you know some characters are able to dash up but Ed in particular he is able to kill Rush forward with no meter needed it's a special move so can't go wrong with this whatsoever so say you do triple lights into medium BL you kill Rush forward and I think in this situation you're Plus 8 or plus 9 off a wake up can't go wrong with that same thing with this into that kill Rush sword into that say you want to throw him kill rush throw them say you want to do like a Dy Rush extension same thing boom boom boom boom boom into medium Blitz which meanss into a plus 42 wake up option off a quick rise you get a save jump off of that boom bo boom boom this is a save jump so for jump heavy punch block a DP punish him if they decide to do that but I feel like most people understand that that is a go-to option but you do have a select fewu players that want to challenge you and think that oh I'm going to challenge the save jump and you're going to find out real quick why you shouldn't challenge a save jump if you challenge a save jump guess what oops my bad you challenge a save jump guess what's about to happen to you well I I I miss Ed it my bad I'm a little booty I'm a little booty just a little bit don't try not to roast me too much but y'all get the gist of what I'm going at with that and same thing with heavy Blitz now heavy Blitz mcream off the tar combo actually leads off into plus 42 so once again if you get this knockdown you plus 42 also they cannot DP you in this situation I'm not a safe jump kill Rush forward R repeat pressure level two you know what I'm saying just Ed is a safe jump monster oh so off of sweep you're actually negative one so you you don't want to do it off a sweep you want to just Dash up off a sweep and be plus 11 all right y'all let's go ahead and talk about his Corner mixup game Corner mixup game so as we all know y'all th Loops are real in this game they are real they are real ladies and gentlemen but Ed in his case his store in the corner is a little bit more deadly why let's talk about it so first things first throw Loop is Dr so I have my opponent set to wake up crouching light which this for frame I can Dash up and get another throw right you can't walk up but you can Dash up oops mistimed it right th Loop is real Ed in this case he has snatcher mix this is a real mix right you you you have to hold at and you can't be out of situation either talking about the fourth a little bit more say they decide to wake up and decide to tap Perry they they want to tap Perry say they want to tap her I could kill Rush forward and throw you for that if that ain't Fair balance I don't know what it is you dig what I'm saying right you got to hold all that plus 42 I keep getting jabed but yes that's plus 42 also another safe jump Corner mix with Ed is very deadly if Ed gets you in the corner you have to make them pay for getting there they will they have to hate be now tether P mix baiting Drive Impact looking for drive impact and even so right say they decide I don't know how to set this up in training mode but you know say you throw them and you hold a tether say they decide to just sit there and just hold Parry right say they decide to sit there and just hold parry and then they drive rush like at the last second or time where they feel like you might not be ready for it or they might drive in no they might drive Rush when they feel like you about to kill Rush forward in order to throw them from holding up the Parry as soon as you see them Drive Rush as soon as you see them Drive rush you can release tether and actually get a full combo off that so as my game in the corner is daily y'all just work on mixing up your options making them guess each knockdown you know don't be scared of mixing your throws your tick those off the jab your shimmies um holding off the tether look looking for the Parry looking for the drive impact pulling them in for plus four making them guess again yeah this Stow Loop is nasty and nasty in the corner y'all y'all have to use it trust me it's amazing all right y so tether mixup game you know I talked about tethers and the special section of this video but you know I actually want to talk about the mix up a little bit you know playing in mid-range right so of course like like I said the mid-range is where you normally want to sit out with this character you want to be holding tethers me I personally I like to actually hold medium tether and heavy tether from this range you don't want to hold light tether cuz it it's not going to reach right you want to be holding medium and and heavy so if they're sitting at that mid-range and they're not doing nothing they're going to get pulled either for a hit or pull in for plus four you know sometimes you might want to do it back upep a few times in order to just play different mind games and when each back step nine times out of 10 you should be holding a different version of the tether cuz you know you're looking for them to jump or you looking for them to sit still right so back step pull them in you know sometimes you can probably back step look look for them to jump once they jump boom snatch them um let me go and set him to jump actually so say I do that into to back step oops Yeah say I do this into back step dve Rush forward into that oops sto the combo ladies and gentlemen like I said Ed is a headache if I'm being honest the C is a headache he's not easy he's fun to play don't get me wrong he's real fun to play executing his combos just playing the character it's it's fun like his play style from Street Fighter 5 to Street Fighter 6 was a tremendous big difference I enjoy him in six way more than five I never even played him in five I probably dabed around with him just a little bit but not too much but in six I personally picked him up and I've been playing them ever since released so the character is fun uh hopefully this video was found helpful if y'all feel like I missed anything any air player I feel like I may have looked over something please put it down in the comment section below let's talk about it and yeah y'all make make sure y hit the like subscribe to the channel and catch yall in the next one
