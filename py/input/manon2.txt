[Music] hey guys MC Maura here and today we're going to talk all about Manon and how you can use her in Street Fighter 6 so let's get started [Music] Manon is one of the main Grapplers of Street Fighter 6 and she has this unique system called the medal levels each time you land either a command grab or hit grab with Manon your medal level will increase by one the maximum is level five and with each level gained your grabs will do more damage hit grabs command grabs and even your level three super all of them will end up doing more as a matter of fact manon's level five command grab is most damaging command grab in the game and the craziest thing about this metal system is that it carries over between rounds so even if you early on happen to land a lot of grabs later your character will be very dangerous this also means that Manon is a character that gets a lot of mileage out of perfect pares because anytime you land a perfect Parry you will typically be able to get a command grab or a hit grab meaning that you meta level will increase making your next move your next pressure sequence that much more dangerous Manana also got surprisingly really good neutral her neutral buttons are great standing medium punch crouching medium punch both of them are highlights her reach her range on her normals are pretty good as well her movement in general is not bad and she does have potentially High rewarding antiair you got crouching heavy punch really good easy to use anti-air also got some options with the OD launcher kick that can lead to AAL level so that is great unfortunately though Manon got the worst Drive rush in Street Fighter six her drive Rush is both very short and kind of slow and there is not really that amazing Drive rush follow-ups for her meaning that to open up the opponents you will most likely have to do it the good old way and unfortunately even once you do Manon got a distinct lack of plus frames so you kind of have to rely a lot on Drive Rush cancel to get a normal to be plus then you can start applying some command grab pressure and even if you Happ to land the command grab or the head grab manon's Oki is not great the situation both throw there is some mix situations but it's not super advantageous mixups so most of the time you will reset to the Neal after landing the command or the head grab and it doesn't really become rewarding enough until you're at level four or level five where your grabs are doing a ton of damage otherwise mostly you're getting luck a situation but nothing that threatening and because you have to build up your medal level this means that unless you're at level four or level five the opponent pretty much can just take the Comm mang grab because uh the damage that you get is not worth it compared to the situation right because this is Street Fighter six most of the times your opponent will Land one combo car you to the corner throw luu there which is a lot harder to deal with as the Manon because she doesn't have an invincible reversal yes she does get a lot of reward out of a perfect par and she does have an invincible subers but uh yeah once you hit them you kind of have to return to the neutral multiple times but at the same time you can get snowballed pretty easy easily but at the same time because of manon's Medal level your snowballing can lead to a ton of mental damage because if you happen to land lot of medals really early you can be very threatening later on and people will play a lot more passively against you giving you more opportunities so this is pretty much a highrisk high reward character with amazing neutral options but unfortunately the Oki isn't that great [Music] [Music] [Music] so let's start first talking about the character light moves and Manon got two four frame lights light Jabs so that is good uh lights obviously at four frame that is the fastest move in Normal can be in this game as you got a standing jab and a crouching jab and on Surface both of them seem to function kind of the same way but standing jab is actually a lot better and a lot more rewarding you want to hit it far more often uh one of the biggest difference is that if you get standing jab you can combo it into medium ballerina right and you can also combo it into light ballerina and these two they give you good damage and they give you good Oak especially if you get the light version that sets up a fantastic okay post hit situation for you uh the crouching Jabs uh I mean the good thing about it is that you can get three of them to combo as you can see you can't get three standing but crouching you can get like three of them but you're only getting the quarter Circle forward kick the launcher kick right this is the only one you're getting uh crouching jab into medium ballerina or even light yeah as you can see it doesn't combo right standing jab actually got a little bit more range as well than the crouching version but this one got less push back so in situations where the opponent knocking you down you are more likely to get like conversion with the crouching version standing jab I will say is a little bit better for pressure once you are trying to pressure them now one good thing about this update is that uh because now there is less push back on crouching light kick Manon can go standing jab crouching light kick standing jab so you're kind of now are able to get like three hitting string out out of this one which is H pretty cool now also standing jab is as you notice this is plus4 on hit crouching is plus three so this means that out of Drive rush for example a drive Rush jab is going to leave you at a plus eight so standing you get a back heavy Bunch into a medal with crouching you're not really getting it that way you're only plus seven this is eight Fram so it's not a combo so in many ways for pressure situations I would like to go for jab a standing jab more for defense situation crouching jab is better now let's say for example that opponent knock you down right K is going to knock me down here I'm going to go for a crouching jab right and let's say that Ken is Magic one strategy you would like to do a lot with Manon is after this counter hit crouching jab Manon is going to be plus five which means that a medium command grab is actually going to frame trap right so this is actually pretty great uh let's say for example here like I showed you Ken is going to knock us down and then he's going to try to like press us right so he I got him to mash right I'm going to interrupt with the jab and then go for the medium command grab and this should actually frame trap him see this I actually got a counter hit on his jab because I'm plus five on this counter hit uh crouching jab uh I can actually frame trb immediately or like take grab into her command grab which is a really uh this is a really good strategy that you want to use with this character yes you can get for like the guaranteed follow-ups if you want but it does do her to be sneaky on defense a little bit and sneak in a command grab uh right in there when they least expected right so both of these moves are pretty vital to her game plan and obviously just like any other character um you can uh frame trap with your rabbit fire Jabs if I do uh two of them as you can see they're going to frame trap into each other despite them being negative on block and obviously like you can frame trap into the light kick and then get follow-ups [Music] see it's kind of the same deal so uh these function in a very traditional way when it come to light now let's talk about her standing light kick and sing Light kick for Manon is a pretty major Button as you can see it's five frames but the range on it is actually fairly good and the headit box is good as well uh this is good on hit uh let's say for example that uh you landed like a far range hit as this one you're getting a standing light kick after crouching medium punch your plus six so this is your best followup right so that is pretty great uh if the opponent say is going to go for a drive Rush this is one of her best Drive Rush sh it's it's really good ad that because it's relatively fast hits low which is hits like a lower head box I don't I don't mean hit low it's not a low attack but it got a lower head box which is pretty good combo into the OD ballerina so you can get some damage this is also one of your best moves to use on block because on block as you can see I I said here can to mash his jab now I can't frame trap with it it doesn't like rabid fire cancel like her uh Jabs but but and this is a good one if you cancel a light kick into a drive rush you can take grab into a heavy command grab so see here Ken is matching his jab if I do light kick Drive Rush heavy command grab I get the counter so this is something that you can be sneaky about right this is something that you can do it's a very good take grab it happens very quickly so there is a good chance that they may not be ready for it and even if you happen to land the hit it's rewarding on hit as well because you get a follow up like that one uh standing L kick Drive rush you get a standing jab so you're getting a back heavy Bunch bam into that so let's say you got a combo like that one right this can also lead to medal right so that is really good now when you use it to interrupt a drive Rush typically this move it doesn't combo into the medium and Light alinaa unfortunately something that I really wish Capcom would buff but it isn't uh so for now say that you interrupted a drive Rush it's going to be counter hit most likely and on counter hit you are getting them so checking with a light kick into medium ballerina well that's pretty good if you want to be totally safe just combo into the launcher kick but you're getting less damage and less oky uh like Corner cry right so n what is left is her crouching light kick and crouching light kick for manone is her low cheick this is her low combo starter as well and this one is really good uh now it got very little push back so as you can see you can combo four of them on a row which is very uncommon in this game that you're getting four lights it combo into her standing jab it combo into her crouching jab and you can even go like standing crouching standing Bam Bam this is pretty good good knockdown same two of them into the standing jab so that's good like let's say for example that uh we are shaking K here right see this I can harass with this one it's one of your best harassment tool especially I will say after a drive Rush uh because a lot of people may try to mash so like you can frame trap with it delay it a little bit uh because you're getting like multiple of them into combos you can kind of check them if they're trying to walk back or get away from your pressure and obviously just like any rapid fires Jabs you can get like you can get it to frame trap into her other light punches and you're getting the counter hit combo so her lights are pretty good for pressure I think and in general one issue with my n that I'm not a big fan of is that none of her lights will like counter hit combo into a medium which is unfortunate you're going to have to go for standing light kick and as you know with this balance patch uh there is more scaling on lights so unfortunately whenever you're hitting like a counter hit jab or like a counter hit light you're only getting standing light kick right which that's a little a bit unfortunate but H it is what it is so let's now go over manon's mediums starting First with her medium punch and her medium punch is a fantastic this is a Workhorse button for Manon it got a Target combo attached to it which is medium punch into medium kick and this one actually is hit confirmable uh you can get the cancel very late right you can cancel into the second head very late and when you do it buls them in and you got plus two Advantage so you can go for a command grab that part of it is really good now because this move as you can see is seven frame and four frame active this make it a fantastic move to use in the neutral you can use it as a buffer you can use it as a shck to drive Rush right say he's Drive rushing here I move forward I am very active so I can check Drive Rush with it and uh it is potentially rewarding as well if you go uh for this sort of application so that is good the move also is pretty good if you're using it as a whiff punish especially against standing moves so if Ken is whiffing something like his standing heavy kick it moves forward it is decently fast so you can use it as a whiff punish against these sort of moves right that part of it is great now you can technically like if he's whiffing something like a crouching medium kick you can technically get it but you have to hit K body you don't hit his extension so see this like I can technically get get a wave punch on a crouching medium kick but it's not favorable uh if you're going for a wave punch against these sort of moves crouching medium punch is way easier and way better right because see this like crouching medium punch I can hit his extension right I can hit the extended hurt box of kin but with the standing version I have to physically hit kin like my her hands have to reach k for her to get a whff punish so you can technically get a w punish on a low move with this one but uh yeah I I wouldn't actually recommend it if that is the intention if that is the intention uh crouching medium punch is the better one for these sort of applications right now this move is also a Workhorse for pressure situation for Manon right this is by far your best Drive Rush cancel button right uh we're here setting can to do a jab right I can standing medium punch Drive rush and do a light command grab and it will take through it will hit him see this let's actually turn the UTS on right so standing medium Bunch Drive Rush light command grab this will hit him even if he's mashing jab see this can is mashing jab you still get the command this is one of her better take grabs right now what a lot of people will try to do in this game is on a drive Rush cancel they're going to try to mash the their o uppercuts right this happens all the time right I I'm going for the button show you and he's going to try to do it now one of the best thing about this move and its ability to drive Rush is that you can actually go for Block streaks as a matter of fact standing medium punch into crouching medium punch is a block string see this this is a legit block string even if he's trying to mash uh his uh uppercut will not come out so you can be saved from rever mashing with this one which is actually fairly great now I showed you that uh you can go for the command grab but also you can go for uh a crouching medium punch right this leaves you at a plus three so this is an option immediate one into grab into crouching medium plus three so into the heavy grab this is also really good uh says that the opponent is not going to try to mash I can delay my crouching medium punch a little bit and get a frame trap I can go for a crouching medium kick which will also frame trb ah you can do so much with this one right and it can be really irritating for people and obviously like you can go for the lows here which can be a fairly annoying but yeah will be good if you delay it a little bit right so yeah like you can do so much out of this drive Rush cancel it's actually kind of nasty right and the good thing about this move is its range is great and it moves Manon forward so if the opponent is going for reversal Japs like K here you can actually set up like spacing traps with it into itself just delays a second hit a little bit which is kind of funny right and obviously you have probably seen the clips if you have watched anything in this game uh if they say if they're in Burnout this become BL three so you can absolutely har I'm sure you've seen like manon's absolutely annoying opponent with the medium punch spam it's h it's actually pretty hilarious so fantastic move now I just showed you that you can use it to do a lot of like Drive Rush pressure and uh one of the options is a drive reversal but there is a good thing about this right uh if you do it immediately and they do like an immediate Drive reversal just like what Ken is doing here there is no counter playay here but but this is a read they can't do it on reaction they can't react to the drive Rush cancel with the drive reversal if I make it the delay by like let's say 13 or like 14 frames this is the regular human reaction nope you get to block the drive reversal and you get to punish on him so that is a pretty great so as I showed you this move is typically minus one uh but you can actually make it plus in some like knockdown situation if you use it as like in a situation like that you can time it to actually be plus see this was plus one I believe I can get it to even be like plus two yeah here it was plus two and I'm in command grab range so even in some Med situations it is very good so it's a fantastic button all around now next up we got her crouching medium punch and as I showed you previously crouching medium punch is very good against like low hitting moves so if he's doing a lot of crouching medium kicks this one this one is very similar to Luke's uh crouching medium punch actually actually let's check out a headbox viewer here right so this is a headbox on her crouching medium punch and as you can see there is massive disjoint it's actually pretty hard to hit Manon her standing medium buch is also fairly good but as you can see headbox is high so not as great against lower hitting moves but this one she's crouching and that makes it great now one good thing about this move as well is that notice this 22 total frames and this one is 24s and because she doesn't move forward it's very hard to whff punish this move you can almost spam it it's very spammable it's very very good right it's very good with punish it's very good buffer and it's just very good all around now this move is plus six on hit right which means that if you Happ to Su I knock him down and like there is a 50/50 here I'm going to go for a command grab and I'm going for a me this move is pretty good because you're going to be at a uh he's blocking right right I'm going to be at the plus six so this means that I'm getting combos so this is the move that you want to press them with if you want to go for like combo followup or command grab it sets up a pretty good 50/50 now as I showed you as well this driver Rush technique this drive Rush setup is very good because this boot you at a plus three after the crouching medium so you can immediately go for a command grab uh say for example here that Ken is going to try to mash his jab yeah yes what's going on yeah I don't know why like I don't know why it whed so much but you are plus three here so your uh your your your heavy command grab should hit him out of his jab so it's it's fairly fairly good for pressure situation right and one thing that I do have to mention though is that this move is not that great to drive rush out of um I mean it can work I don't hate it's pretty rewarding because you can get it into himself into the medal level and all of that but uh you can't make a block string outfit so it's like if he's mashing his uppercut he will get me every time here there's nothing I can do there is nothing I can do the only thing that you can do is a drive impact which is like that is a very ballsy read if feel like if you're going for that ah you're wild you are wild if you're going for this sort of play but yeah I figured I should say it but it's very very wild play but yeah typically you can't really like force a block string out of this one uh the uppercut is very much guaranteed only standing medium punch can be uh cancelled into driver rush and then you can go for a block string so fantastic button all around obviously very useful in combos as well now next upop let's talk about her crouching medium kick and this is also uh pretty much your main poke with Manon this is a poke that you're going to be using all the time with her it's a low hitting move it's 8 frame startup four frame active so fairly active and because it's 27 total frames you are it's very difficult to get hit by Drive Impact right so that is good uh the move is minus two on block so unfortunately you can't spam it but the good thing about it is that it is a plus three on hit so you at least get to shck with a medium Punch If you happen to get the hit so that is good if you get the counter hit uh you are going to be plus five which means that you get a light kick into followup so that is uh pretty good if you got a punish counter uh it's going to be plus seven so you can get a standing medium punch so that is a pretty great uh it's a move that you're going to be using all the time now there is also some setups where you can use this one I I will go over like the setups when we get to the command grab and special and all of that but there's like setups like that where uh you can get massive damage and OK from it uh stay tuned to this one it's going to be in the special section so that is one that one is actually pretty important right now what is left is her standing medium kick and her standing medium kick is good against the crouching medium kick type moves right it's it gots this uh like sweep the ground type of Animation which is fairly good but it's 10 frames and it's it's really slow like for this sort of deal I feel like crouching medium punch and standing medium punch pretty much got you covered so I don't love it I don't love it to be honest now you can use it in some situations after say a after like a command grab if you want to go for like a drive because out of a drive rush it combos into her overhead o overhead special uh so like you can go for something like this and then you're getting combo so I guess this is some sort of application for it but it it's a hard move to use right and the the worst thing about it is that very negative on Block it's minus 5 so yeah I I I I don't love it this is probably her weakest medium but it does have some utility but it's very very specific now what is left is the back medium kick and this one got a Target combo attached to it which is back medium kick into medium kick the second hit is an overhead this is an natural combo so say that you got an jumin right this is not a bad combo you have to go for the ballerinas or the launcher kick you don't get a head grab you don't get uh the OD head grab you get nothing so something to keep in mind um it got some use in Combos and it got buffed now where uh like you can use it in situations like that but there are better combos to use in this instance so I don't think that is that big of a deal but this move is actually very good to use in situations where you want to press the opponent uh because as you can see uh you can really stagger the second hit and they got to guess right like let's say for example I I I knock down Ken here and he's going to wake up right uh say I can go for the first hit and although I'm negative uh maybe he's waiting for the second part right because I can do the second board right so maybe he's going to try to block it out and I can go for the command grab or or I can knock him down and then go for a regular grab or I can uh like let's say let's say even that he's going to block it and then try to go for like an OD uppercut I can do I can do the first part and just wait and it's safe right uh he can't really do much here that is going to be like forcing a punish on me so in that sort of situation it's also really good it's also pretty useful I will say in some OK situations like like this one is pretty great and they did buff this move so that it got forward momentum out of a drive Rush as you can see so you can use it out of a drive Rush unfortunately 10 frames so it's on the slower end but the good thing about this is that it is hit confirmable so let's now go over my non Heavies and these are really straightforward super super straightforward crouching heavy punch this is your main anti-air so can it jumping at you you do it it got Target combo attached to it uh but they have to be fairly low for you to get the second hit but when you do you're doing 1200 so it's an okay damage output and the Oki situation is uh pretty good right you immediately get to press them so cing heavy Bunch dedicated anti-air her sweep is uh in the slower end unfortunately 11 frames so it is slow and it's pretty bad on Wave 139 total frames but it's fairly long and it's pretty rewarding with punish like if Ken with a heavy kick you do it bam it's a hard knockdown so you immediately get in and can apply your pressure so pretty good with punish now speaking of with punishes and pokes and neutral standing heavy kick this is your main poke and absolutely one of her best moves I think the range on it as you can see is tremendous it hits from very far and it complement her ground game really well it's really good move as well if you want to attack your opponent drive because it takes a good abortion like it takes about like 60% or so of a drive gauge so that is a pretty good but but as you can see it is 43 total frames of Animation which means that you are very susceptible to drive impact right yeah you you're very susceptible to drive impact with this one and also her sweep right so you got to be careful this is not the moves that you can just throw around right and it is pretty bad on block actually it's minus 6 so you want to use it from the tip range or like relatively for range to avoid getting punished remember almost all standing light kicks and most mediums for like a lot of characters got six frame mediums so yeah you want to space it out use it from a far range and the startup also makes it hard to use from a close range now you do get like a spin State punish counter on this one like let's say he waves a heavy kick but from the range you're going to be using it from uh typically you're only getting like a medium kick ballerina or a light ballerina right so the reward isn't great if you are close enough I mean you can get a Combos and you can get like a normal to connect I the advantage here isn't great you're only at like plus 17 so like most likely you're not getting like a drive Rush you're not getting like a pretty good drive Rush followup right it's not like you're not dj or going to get like a drive rush crouchy medium into amazing combos so the reward isn't fantastic right the reward unfortunately isn't that great but from the range you're going to be using it from ah medium ballerina you're getting good decent Corner carry so good poke but be careful uh her standing heavy bunch is also a really good move to use in the neutral uh because this one is actually pretty good at shipping away at your opponent so you're be like checking them with a crouching medium kick with a heavy kick and then like eventually the one crouching standing heavy punch uh and this one is fairly safe it's only minus three and does pretty good damage to their Drive gauge so you can use it a lot in that situation especially like especially like let's say for example that um they only got one stock left you can go for the Target combo and force a burnout right so in that sort of application it's actually veryy good because the target combo by itself almost does like more than one bar of drives so you can use it to force a burn out right and you also use it as a wave punish it's not bad to use as a wave punish as well uh the first hit is actually super cancelable and you can hit confirm it into subers on D and the scaling is pretty good on this one as well right so you can go for that you can obviously get like a level three as well if you want so it's it's pretty good wave punish and you can like super cancel it's also pretty useful after the command grab Oki let's say that he is going to uh wake up with a jab right because this gets you at a plus six so you can get a standing light kick if you want right so you can get that or obviously you can commit to the rest of the target combo and just bu them in for the mix uh unfortunately it's not like Ultra rewarding and like to for you to be ultra rewarded here uh like you got to uh like super cancel which is not the easiest to do so yeah I I wish like you could like super cancel the second hit it would have made it a lot better but yeah it is what it is like for you to get the big reward you have to make like super hard read and then you're making like a hit confirmed so that that's kind of difficult right but I mean the good thing about it is that even if they block after this like if you do the command grab into it and they block you're still plus one so that is good and you are safe from Drive Impact as well the thing is sometimes this happen where the game will actually give you like the second hit yeah right I don't like to use it because like I showed you sometimes the game is going to give you the second like if you're trying to di ey because there is a heavy sometimes see this like if I'm trying to recover and then do the drive impact sometimes I'm still in the cancer range so you're getting the second hit which means that you're getting hit by the drive impact so uh yeah it's an okay move right uh what is left is her uh back heavy bunch back much this another one that is like a Workhorse for this character it's her only blome block normal at a plus one and uh yeah like the push back on it isn't great but but it's still it's still fairly good I think this move is still very very good for her it's one of her best like hit confirmable moves which actually means a lot because this is a move that you will need to hit confirm say for example I go for a crouching medium bunch out of a dri Rush right like I showed you this one puts you at an advantage right it's plus three so maybe I will go for the command grab or maybe I will go for the hit now the good thing is see this situation it it still leaves him in a float State and you can absolutely hit confirm this that cancel you can do it very late see how late I'm canceling it and you still get this one so this is something that you absolutely need to like to study with Manon is getting the head confirm here uh that one is actually really big right and this move well you can use it in like um knockdown situations as well because it's going to be massively bless like just as the one you saw let's say uh let's just make him uh block after the first hit right so in a knockdown situation like that I can use it and see this was plus eight on block so like you getting massive plus frames with this one uh you can use it here just without a driver Rush was plus six so that is kind of wild and uh if you use it like this mey if you get it to be like this mey it will be plus enough like here plus eight so you can get like combos after it so I even got like a medium punch after it so it's very useful in like combos it's very useful in me situations it's very useful in mixup situation if you things are going to jump it's a fantastic move all around and the good thing about it is that it's still your turn after they block it so if say he's trying to like uh do anything I can still check him with a standing light kick so it's a pretty amazing move all around and now she doesn't have this move which is uh the slide ah this move is very very situational um you can use it to switch sides like say I'm in the corner I got a drive impact I can do something like this and switch sides or I can like back dash into it and just switch sides and you got plus frames uh say for example I'm fighting a character like let's switch characters so that I want to show you this okay so fre Kimberly is doing like a regular jump on One recording in the other we're going to have her do the elbow right so we can turn both of them on and this is a good anti-air if the opponent got to move like that which is like here she's doing the regular kick if she's going for the elbow I also still get the antier please do the elbow once see like you're getting the anti-air both ways so I mean you can use it in situations like this now this move also is pretty weird on a punish counter because it Bulls the opponent in so this is also useful against for example character like dlim who got very long range like if you hit dlim if you with punish one of his lims like let's say he's doing like a heavy punch you get to Bull him closer so very very situational uses but against very against characters that can change the jump Arc if you want to switch sides if you want to wh punish someone with a long L like d her slide it actually can work so let's now go over Manon special moves and the game plan in general I'm also going to go over some Oki some setups because there's a lot to go into here uh so the first thing with Manon is her most R forward special which is a quarter Circle forward and kick I like to call this the launcher kick and they look like an anti-air and they are anti-air a old version of them will anti-air light one comes out pretty fast and the headbox on it is fairly good but like it's only upper body involved so if the jumping is very deep you can't really use it it's not like a true uppercut but it is good enough I think right and um old version light medium heavy if you get the heavy version and you got it to hit just right uh you can actually combo like a light H grab after words it's kind of finicky though see like this can work if you Happ to get but as you can like it's finicky if you want to go for like the guaranteed uh Z the OD version is the best one the startup is good eight frames so it's really fast and it launches them pretty high for a Juggle making the follow-up head grab uh fairly consistent right this is probably your most rewarding anti-air as that you can go for so it's actually pretty great now the thing about this moves is all of them will also combo from light attacks so jab into light kick into medium kick into heavy kick all of them will give you combos so that is pretty good now this move is a little bit weird because light version does 900 medium version does 1k heavy version does 800 so the heavy version does the least damage but it does have the benefit of being the only version that is cancelable into level three super right this is a combo and and it puts you in the best situation afterwards so afterwards see like I'm very close to Ru if I go for the medium version I'm pretty far uh if I go for the light version I'm also decently far so for like the best Okie situation the best knockdown situation you want to go for the uh heavy version this typically why most of the time like you're going to do lights into the heavy to stay close to the opponent Manon at at the end is a Grappler so you want to stick to them right the AI version like I showed you is a launcher and uh you can get a lot here like you can get the medium ballerina for good Corner carry if you want the best Okie you can go for La light ballerina it's not a fantastic Oki situation like raw grounded light kick sweep but still it's it's still pretty okay uh you can get like a level one super which is really good like let's say for example you here knocked us in the corner and he went for something right and I did like jab Jab into the OD launcher kick level one super and I got out of the corner that sort of situation that sort of utility is fairly important and obviously because it's an OD move you can cancel it into level two super and D it opens up her most high damage and obviously it's an anti-air as well like anti-air OD kick into the level two you don't even have to cancel this one and it will still combo so that is pretty good open up some of her most damaging combos in the corner as well because you can get two of them to combo into each other and right that's almost like 5K so that's actually pretty damaging and after two of them in the corner you can combo into a light uh head grab as well uh you can you can get like Drive Rush combos here so yeah it opens up a lot of doors to some of her most damaging combo rot right so pretty important move all around he so yeah pretty straightforward but pretty useful move now let's talk about her other special her other kick special and the ballerina kicks as I like to call them three different version light medium and heavy and as you can see these ones are totally different the light this one is a low it got fantastic range it goes very far and it BR you a fantastic OK situation uh does pretty good damage as well 1K the medium version does the most damage and this one doesn't give you like good situation unless you're in the corner but the corner carry is actually fairly decent I will say on this one carries into the corner fairly well and in the corner in the corner this leads to some like ridiculous oky situations so we're going to show them a little bit later uh but uh yeah it's unsafe obviously this one is massively unsafe on block and the light one is like oh my Godus 24 on block so you're dying if they block this one the heavy version is an overhead it's -9 it is the safest one and this does give manone some pretty good annoying uh presence in the neutral uh because you can shake them with a heavy kick you can annoy them with a crouching medium kick uh you got the medium that moves forward this one which is really good against a crouching medium kick moves uh you got the sweep which is a fantastic whiff punish and when you're busy with all of this you also got an overhead that is really annoying and low and uh this is kind of like a Vega slide a bison slide these characters every once in a while you want to throw out a random slide why because you want the opponent to down back if I got you to down back this means that I can then like Dash forward for the command grab approach him and close the distance so I have to make him worry a little bit about this right it's something that you got to throw out every now and then to make them think about it right now the overhead is also really good against like low hitting moves sometimes because you are prone to getting hit it's not like a through low Crush but at the at the end of it uh if you get like a punish counter it's very rewarding so if you Happ to get it just like that as her legs up like you can get massive uh rewards right because in this sort of situation this move becomes plus seven and it forces them into like a crouching stance so you you can combo it into a medium Bunch so if you're lucky and you have to get the head just right uh you can do massive damage with this one right now what is left is the overhead and like the OD version and the OD version is straight up the overhead version right now one thing I want to say about the the overhead version is that it's 20 frame startup and unfortunately 20 frame means that it can be perfect pared on Rea action if they are looking for it the startup is slow enough to be perfect variable on reaction if they're looking for it so you got to be careful but if you're looking for it this means that you can walk forward you can check with a jab driver Rush crouching medium Bunch uh annoys them with a heavy kick so if you are like super focused on it this allow you to do a lot of other things so figured I have to mention that right but yeah it's very big part of your neutral presence I will say right now the ODI version is good because the ODI version is safe on block actually it's only minus three which is fairly great uh the OD version as well puts her at a plus six Advantage so you can combo like a light kick after and that is really nice if they are crouching uh this becomes plus seven which means that you're getting like a medium so you can get combos like this after it if you're close enough Bam Bam yeah it's hard you kind of need it to be like a drive rush or like a cancel to get this but yeah like after it you do get like a crouching medium Bunch or standing medium Bunch if they're crouching right so that is great now remember when I told you that um you can get very high reward out of a punish counter overhead well because this one forces a Crouch stand as you see it puts you at a plus seven Advantage so this means that you are likely getting something lik this see this this can open up some very high damaging routs for Manon so this also is funny enough like her best uh most damaging like uh combo situation as well if you're getting the punish counter and you want to go for the most damage this one is a fantastic starter so say thatu is going for like a wake up OD uppercut [Music] this is massive damage this is the most damage that Manon can get so yeah it's it's a pretty fantastic move all around but you got to be careful if the opponent has showed you that they are really looking for they really looking for it right uh now let's talk about her grabs because Manon got two grabs there is the command grab and then there is the head grab right head grab for my is a kind of a weird move because you do quarter Circle forward and punch and if you don't press anything she does a head grab right but if I hold the button she just does the spin and the spin does grant you Fireball immunity like you can spin through Fireballs so that is not bad and if you are um you can even like go for the head grab through Fireballs actually just like that but obviously this is massively unsafe right very unsafe of you if and uh the H grab is blockable so if I do this and it gets plugged yeah I'm minus 16 so I'm getting full combo punished but if you hold the kick if you like as she's spinning if you press a kick she does this followup right and this is supposed to be like her main ways against uh fireballs and you can get like big reward here as you can see like you can get like massive rewards on this one but this is so finicky I like it's it's not consistent at all like it's only working now because he's doing like the heavy version but if he's throwing out the light version see like it's very easy to get stopped if you let it go and just go for the grab that is the best but if you want to go for the kick yeah that is rough it's it's very hard to Spain through slow projectiles man you want to let it go but again she might just stop in front of them so the Audi version is the best if you want to go for like this sort of situation ODI version is your best bet against Fireball this is the one that is the most consistent and the one that's probably going to get you some results now anyways uh notice there is one beneath manon's health bar right and this is her medal level Manon got this system called the medal level where every time you throw someone whether that is a head grab or a command grab you are getting a medal right so this for example is her level one head grab right and on a grounded opponent the only way to get a natural combo into the head grab is by using the back heavy Bunch so you go back heavy Bunch into the medium or the light head grabs right and notice this one okay we got a knockdown now we got a two right if I go for the h grab once more the combo did 2200 now is doing 2350 now we are at the level three if I go for it once more notice the animation is a little bit different 2500 so a little bit more damage this is the level four one 2650 so we're doing a little bit more damage and now we are at level five which is Max now transition into this really fancy animation and we're doing 2800 so this same combo started at 2K now we're doing 2800 so the damage of up gets a lot and lot better now the post hit grab situation doesn't differ right uh let's not make him do the OD uppercut this leaves me at this distance and I'm at plus 15 Advantage if I got level five it's going to be the same distance and you're also just going to be at plus 15 Advantage so the distance doesn't change and the frame Advantage doesn't change right I feel like this is important to discuss only things that change is the damage right so there is never like a time where you are discouraged from going for the medal level because the o key the most hit situation well it's pretty much consistent right now with Manon you want to go for medals as much as possible right because this like uh like if if I'm at level one my command grab does 2k but if I'm at level five my command grab will does 3700 so the increase in damage output especially for like the command grab is substantial right so you want to end your combos with the head grab as much as possible and that's why most of the times you will see my non blers doing this ending their combos with the head grab because it gives you a safe way to build up metal levels it give you a safe way to make your approach the next time you are close to them the next time you get to run your pressure it makes it that much more threatening with every metal level you become more and more dangerous right now once you actually get the hit here uh the situation both the H grab is a little bit weird right uh let's save state so I can show you what I mean actually let's do it a little bit further into the animation right so you got A plus 15 Advantage right which isn't a lot and uh but it's good enough to use some driver Rush shananigans uh let's say for example that youu is going to try to wake up with a jab right this plus 15 is enough for me to be able to drive Rush crouching medium punch and getting me on him right so that is a fairly good it's also enough uh for me to go for like a like if you get the head confirm here you can go for to like another one but it's very difficult to do that typically you're not going to that you're most likely going to go for something like this which again is not that bad right now the issue with this sort of situation is this will also catch them actually if they're trying to jump so let's say for example that they're trying to like back jump cuz I want to show you like all of the different follow-ups that you can get here so even if they're trying to jump you're getting this you're getting the combo so that's good right the issue with this situation is you can't do anything to the OD uppercut like you can't stop here right you can't stop your aeration you can't wh jab and stop there is nothing that you really can do the only thing that you can do is the drive impact and the drive impact here will whiff as you can see and you're going to have Advantage so like you can go for a command gr this is also character specific it's different versus guile to DJ to Ken to jury everyone is a little bit different but this is one of your options right so it's not fantastic but it is one of your options that you can use now there are a couple of things also to note here is if you don't want to commit to something that is this risky uh you can simply just like walk forward slightly and go for a heavy Bunch this is a good check especially say let's say that again are you we're going to set him to try to jump [Music] right I can get him like that which is not bad if he try to mash his jab as well you can get the counter hit on him with that that was very Weir train right so heavy bunch is good you can go for a crouching medium kick as well the situation isn't fantastic here but you're not getting like like legit ok but there are some things that you can do now there is something very interesting about the head grab in the corner and that is the fact that if you go for like the OD H grab it leaves you closer right so notice this this is the light version for example my non is at like the buckler sign right but if I go for the ODI version she's going to be very much closer to him now I'm in range to command grab him without even walking I'm in range for Comm M grab so in the corner uh if you happen to get this one it's it's a medal that you really to use but you are much closer so you can straighten like the command grab you can straighten a me etc etc so it puts you in a much better position right something that is very rare I haven't seen any manom player actually specifically go for that but something that you can do right and obviously you have seen the combo uh if you get the back heavy Bunch you can combo it into the OD spin kick and this does open up the door for some like pretty cool uh combos for her into the light H grab and then you're getting okay you got a pretty good Corner carry so that is uh pretty cool right head grab is good for her you're mostly going to be us it from combos but I have to stress that the situation here isn't that great so if say I'm at level three or four uh it might actually be better like say for a combo like that one one um maybe it's actually better to just simply go for this sort of knockdown uh because you are getting better okys right so it's good but it doesn't give you fantastic Okie right so something that you got to keep in mind now let's talk about some of her command grabs because command grab is obviously the biggest uh gameplay aspect of Manon uh Manon obviously got the light the medium the heavy and what's different about them is the startup and range they all do the same damage so level one heavy uh this does 2k uh medium will also do 2K light will do two all of them will do even the Odie version even the ODI version still does the same damage what's different is the speed and range light got the most range but the slowest speed as the range for it is around the dash distance like something around here it's 10 frames start up though which is really slow medium is 8 frames but a little bit less range heavy one you got to be pretty close but it's five frames so it is the fastest heavy heavy command grab is the fastest command grab right now I showed you many ways where you can take throw with Manon uh like for example after a light kick light kick into the heavy command grab this is a tick grab medium Bunch into the light version this is a tick grab obviously like you can jump or like even go for this on some knockdowns into command grab so there is a lot of tcks but a good part of playing this character will be just knowing when you can do it right uh she's she doesn't got an autopilot something that is super amazing she doesn't got like an OD Contra Spire that is a straight up 50/50 or isi forward heavy punch headbuts that is just 50 like you're going to have some sense in when you want to use it right you got to get a feel on when the opponent isn't looking for it and when you can use it now the post command grab situation is also pretty important uh notice this one leaves you at a plus 19 frame Advantage so uh let's let's let's save it here and let's check out what we can do right because B command grab well this is a situation right now you can do a drive rush into a heavy Bunch right this one this is one of the options and this one you will be plus six but you're far away from being able to connect with anything uh you don't getting medium you don't get much so you're pretty much going to be doing this or if you can uh you can like hit confirm into sub although that is somewhat difficult but this is one of the things that you can do uh like I showed you previously as well this is safe from di so one of the things that you can do is drive impact using it because of this because sometimes you're going to get like the second hit and this can really screw you over so this this is an option that you can go for I personally don't love it I don't go I don't go for this one that much because even if you just uh ended up blocking the situation afterwards you plus one but you're far away from being able to apply a command grab so I don't absolutely love this one I like to go for the medium punch a little bit more uh because you do get like a much better followup here like let's say that he's he went for the standing Jab right I can go for this target combo I can go for like the medium ballerina yeah and do obviously it's not that reliable because you got to hit it mey but you get the point right uh but you can go for that and this one is very consistent uh very good and obviously I can go for another medal level if I really want it so that is not bad um so this one I kind of like and obviously they do like wake up uh Drive Impact because this is just a medium I am pretty much safe yeah like it's so safe it's so easy to use so this one I actually kind of like right now another things that you can do is uh Drive rush into another command grab it's good as ground to go for a drive impact and sometimes the opponent uh will try to go wake up with a py and obviously if if they are expecting that if they're expecting you to do like a drive Rush button this can happen a lot right so you can't be too predictable with this right it's not that free you can't really be that predictable with this one uh because uh wake up Drive Parry is an issue but if you're going for wake up Drive Parry this means that a drive Rush command grab it works other things that you can do is simply go for the overhead you at a plus 19 Advantage as they are uh it's 20 frame startup so this can work and on that you get like a counter it which is not that bad be careful though because Drive Impact is dangerous uh if they like to wake up Drive Impact a lot this is something that uh like unless your timing is immaculate you're going to get punish countered so you you got to be pretty careful here right so I I I really love this one so much but it is good it's it's a good something to throw around every now and then and obviously Z waking up with a DI is a very big call right um but some people do it so unless the opponent showed you they not going to do it I I I don't go for it that much as a start right but it is there it's something that you've got to keep in mind and what is left obviously is just what to do when an opponent got a reversal um because all of this will lose lose to reversals right all of this will lose to a reversal now Manon thankfully got a pain which is you drive rush into with jab right you can do that you can bait the reversal and you are still getting the knockdown so that is pretty good right you can do other gimmicks like a spin empty Spin and maybe you will see the forward movement and wake up was an uppercut and you get a punish on them so yeah there's a lot that you can do after like the command grab situation and obviously once you got them uh like worried and they're not doing that much you can start mixing in like um like just dashes into grabs you're going to have to really mix up what you do here right if I got him convinced I can then Dash up into like Aang grab that sort of deal right there's no like fix it Blazer or some options that you got that are legit but you have to mix in a lot of fake as well to make this character work uh this one obviously is hard though uh because uh this is manual timing so uh you're going to have to rely on your own manual timing which can be a little bit finicky but there are some other options that are really good one of the ones that I really like now are sitting him up to do like a wake up uh jab one of the ones I really like is Drive rush back medium kick right and this one is great because this one is hit confirmable and you can kind of lube the situation because even like for example here even if I got like the counter hit on plus six which mean I can go for like a medium command grab which is a fairly good if he happen to block I'm still at a plus two Advantage so I can go for like a heavy command grab so that is pretty good and obviously I can like even if he happen to like block it I can always like stagger the second hit I go for a grab that sort of deal so this lets you have multiple turns of blade uh this one I really like another one that you can do is a drive Rush crouching medium kick this one gives you a plus five advantage and the good thing about it is you are in range for a medium command grab although they may back walk something that I have to uh let you know so you better off using the OD uh command grab right not everyone expect this because the separation make it seems like it's really far but yeah gives you a lot of plus frames and this happens so fast right you might catch them off guard this is also massively rewarding on hit because this crouchy drive Rush C medium kick becomes a plus 10 which means that you're getting like a back heavy bunch and you're getting like this new sort of combo which is fairly good this is excellent stuff uh you can also especially like if you're near the wall you can go for like a drive rush back heavy bunch and this one is so meaty it's going to be plus 10 and this gives you plus plus eight advantage on this knockdown like on this drive rush back heavy Bunch you're going to be plus eight which means that you can take grab with a a light command grab so this is really good and obviously like if they happen to press a button here uh they will uh get massively punished right again like you're getting massive combos on this one so let K Arena give you a fantastic knockdown now the best thing about this is you can drive rush and Z block so if you got a read on Z doing like the wake up reversal you can absolutely just block and absolutely great now another knockdown that is really good for her that uh we have discovered is a save jump and a save jump after this setup right uh this is also very good jump for Manon actually uh this is her basic bre and butter combo what you can do is now like Drive R jab into the medium kick Bina and this give you good advantage to go for a save jump right so let me show it to you dver jab into the medium ballerina I jump heavy kick and I get to block on time and obviously I get like a big punish on him so this is also a safe jump which means that if they are blocking uh I want him to block hit you like obviously means that you can make him block and then go for the command grab or if he's like waking up with a Patty I can like empty jump and then go for the command grab which will deal big damage right so uh I feel like these were some setups that I wanted you to see uh because they are pretty important for this character now finally let's talk about about manown super the her level one is a pretty good one it's 10 frames it's a reversal so that is good it also switches sides and you can easily like combo into it from her OD launcher kick you can combo into it if you hit confirm a heavy Bunch you can combo into it from lights so this one is very very standard now there is an issue with it and that the fact that it hits low so if the opponent does something that is like Airborne like a can Dragon lash kick [Music] this can happen where like it will straight up lose sometimes so and obviously if he got like a me Fireball uh like let's see for example here in the corner K is going to throw us go for like Fireball uh you can't use it in this situation uh you're going to get hit right I got no Fireball invincibility so this one is a very very straightforward subar now one thing that is good to know about it is if the opponent doesn't back rise like if the opponent recover in place after it uh you actually are in range to command grabs him it's it leaves you at a plus seven Advantage so let's say that he's going to wake up with a jab you are actually in range to go for a light command grab immediately and it will beat him right but if they go for a back rise uh yeah they're they're going to land up further away from you and obviously no command grab for you but a lot of people don't know this so you can absolutely get away with this one uh her level two subar is also an invincible move this is her best reversal this is just a damaging move now the good thing about this one is it also is really good as an anti-air like sometimes people will knock you down like that H they want to catch you in a situation like this one even if you wake up with it as a reversal you're going to catch them so that is a very good uh you can actually use it as an anti-f Fireball tool although that is kind of hard but like from this range from the neutral on dude I jinxed it you know what forget about it it can work actually UND do dude so like it can work against fast projectiles but the invincibility frames AR in that massive right but this is pretty good and uh it's fairly easy to combo into again like any times you land an OD ballerina kick you can immediately cancel into it you can even do it like without a cancel on a jugle like that if you want like you can go like straight up cancel or just a Juggle in the corner there is some big combos where you can get it and and even like in corner situations like Z I just showed you where he's like going for like a me Fireball uh this one works this is a reversal sub that you can use that will get you the punish and do to but obviously this is like two bars for a reversal so yeah now what is left is her level three and her level three is a command grab that they can jump after the flash this is a straight up like a damage sub you can use it as a reversal if it's going to kill now the good thing about this sub is that scales with her medal level so if I go for the regular level one this should do 4K right yeah it's seven frame startup so I guess you can use it to punish some stuff so not that many but the good thing is like I show you this is level one that 4K if I'm at level five this will now do 4.6k so that is not bad he 4.6k that is H fairly good and uh obviously if you got the critical art that is uh 500 more damage so any proper combo like says for say for example that I got like a says that Ken blocked a d that I blocked like I blocked a DP from Ken right see this is doing massive damage yeah just a oh my God what I got too excited uh yeah just the RO critical art does a ton of damage [Music] let's man but unfortunately this sub pretty much puts you in the same situation as her head grab so the OK situation afterwards isn't uh that great and that's about it for Manon uh she's a straightforward character uh mostly she's going to be around neutral and how you can set up your mind games after the command grab especially uh this will pretty much determine your success with her if you have enjoyed this video please leave a like or a comment it helps the channel so much I will be leaving a link to the patreon Discord Twitter and twitch pages in the
