before I know you guys are going to crack a lot of jokes about you know this should only be 2 seconds long and Honda's super easy to play and yes he does crush lower ranks but this is a master rank Honda guide okay and damn dude when I play this character we're ranking up with him man it is way harder than you think it is I was so surprised how tough it was uh to beat mastering players with Honda once people know how to deal with this character you you you really see why he's considered like bottom three you know on the ter es man especially with so many Akuma and zeni players we had to play so yeah this guide is going to be how can you win with Honda in master rank and we'll be focusing a lot on season 2 Honda because they nerfed a lot of things so now he's even more limited on what you can do so let's talk about the three biggest things with Honda headbutt butt slam and standing medium punch those are the very very important even though headbut got nerfed and there were some changes to it it's still his essential like this is what defines H you still have to use headbutt it's his signature move so uh let me just briefly discuss the Nerfs they did to it so the biggest thing is when you do headbutt now and the opponent jumps over it uh Honda will stop right next to them so if the opponent just jumps like they usually do before Honda just went right pass them but now they can fullon punish you no matter where you are on the screen on top of that uh they made it minus three on block uh rather than minus 4 which is good that's considered a buff but he's closer now so now you're in this weird mind game of the opponent's advantage and he's close enough to walk forward and throw you so we're going to try to take advantage of that as much we can and how to deal with that so the first thing I can say is that headbutt now I don't recommend using this at all like full screen away it's just too dangerous man unless like the opponent knock down you want to surprise them but very sparingly now you need to use headbutt hella close close enough where it's hard for him to react with Perry and you want to still alternate between the different strengths so light headbutt is slow heavy headbutts really fast and you need to throw off your opponent's timing as much as you possibly can because headbutt still has mad priority you know if the opponent is pressing a button can I even time this uh your headbutts going to blow them up and do Mass look that was 1,800 damage man bad deeps and on top of that if they're not pairing this thing uh still takes off a chunk like a one bar of Drive meter you know so it's still very rewarding every time you get away with headbutt but yeah now you got to use it more like a fireball where you're like really close to them and you're using your buttons now and alternating between the strengths super important okay let's talk about the m game now after your opponent Blocks Your headbutt so the first thing you can do is check them so crouching light punch into medium headbutt uh you're first going to see if your opponent knows what to do on Block with this thing if they press any button that's too slow like a lot of people will use like crouching medium kick or you know they mediums or something and they do that uh they're going to get blown up by your jab and you'll steal your turn so let get Cam to do like crouching medum kick or something so I'll go like this bam blows her up yeah first knowledge check your opponent with headbutt that's the first thing I recommend and then on top of that if they don't press a button at all and they're just scared then you know you've you've deleted two bars of dry Mir that's already hella good man for Honda you want to get these guys burnt out as fast as possible cuz poor Honda they didn't give him throw Loops man so even when you get him to the corner it's still your your wing condition is pretty much drive impact now uh from berno okay so what happens when the opponent does know what the Press so let's say they start doing like you know Crouch and light punch on you or standing light kick uh this is where you have to go for the turn steel we'll call it so let's get can we do crouching light punch okay so now when I'm trying to press crouching light punch cammy's going to beat me right and then she can go crouching light punch standing light kick spiral arrow and then I'm in the mix I'm I'm in super trouble so what you need to do to stop this is perfect Parry bam perfect Parry it's not your turn it's my turn and you steal it back I don't know exactly what should I do to punish this but let me check real quick guys what does Honda do here okay on just headbutt then just knock him down with headbutt keep it simple for now I'm sure someone's going to mention something better all right and the third thing you can do after they block your headbutt is the OD headbutt challenge the classic right cuz if you know they're going to check you with a button instead of timing the perfect Parry you simply just go right into OD head butt which didn't work in my example perfect there we go that way you strike fear into them and make them second guess pressing a button in the first place because when you go for perfect par you don't necessarily know what button they're going to use so and therefore know the timing so once they're scared then you start blowing them again and yes I know this is risky guys but dude you're playing Honda okay you have to take some risk with this character he's considered like the weakest character in the game by a lot of players so why play Honda at this point you can't play this character straight up honest you're going to have to un and you're going to have to Bunga at some point best where I get why you should un but do you really need to banga yes with Honda in master rank you do I I know it sounds like I'm joking guys I'm telling you this character is a nightmare against people that know what they're doing don't do this Forever by the way don't do this like you do one rep and then just keep going forever don't do that okay just do it once like two bars is good enough and go back to n otherwise you know you're you're playing way too risky at that point uh last tip I can give for headbutt guys is auto correct headbutt so there's two ways first if your opponent's really close to you um you can autoc correct it this way uh okay how do I explain this so I'm on the left side of the screen I charge down back and when they jump over me I press back and punch I'm not pressing forward Because by the time I've charged this Camy will make make me turn directions and I have to switch directions myself like this this is only if they jump like cross you up when you're close like this and you can use OD as well really important to know as a Honda player cuz you're very susceptible to crossups and people are going to mess with your charges man when you're kind of around this distance when you can't you can't do that method you're going to have to do an auto correct so this way when they're a little bit further from you you charge down back and you do the headbutt like you normally do press forward uh but you have to do it as late as you possibly can because if you otherwise you'll just you know that would just happen so charge it wait last second and screw up hold on wait charge there we go and that will happen I recommend using the OD headb for Speed otherwise once again that's going to happen and they're going to block it but it is possible let's talk about butt slam now butt slam Nerfs first so butt slam got Nerfs but it got a really good buff first off the Nerf is that when the opponent blocks this thing you're no longer in command grab range or attack range wait can you do standing light punch you can do standing light punch but you can't do Crouch a light punch and then do the you know the loops where Honda kept on doing butt slam forever and you know gold players were getting skinned alive and uh command grab as well so that's the Nerf but the cool buff to this is when you hit the opponent uh you're now directly next to them plus 23 baby you don't need to dash anymore after this thing now you get true oky DOI so plus 23 is really really good before we get into the Oki though um General uses for the butt slam once again I would suggest using this very sparingly this is even easier to perfect Parry than than headbutt so I highly recommend that when you do use butt slam definitely mix in the light and heavy versions you want them to be pretty extreme look how fast the heavy version Falls it's like bam straight down straight down but the light version it takes a long time see how much slower the delay it really throws off uh your opponent's Parry timing so mix in the light and Heavies as much as you can um I mostly use this to escape the corner if I'm in a bad situation I'm I'm butt slamming out I'm out of here you know this is my side I'm out of here butt slam is is a good time to use it usually it'll go past your opponent so that could be really good you can use the OD for Ang cuz it's mad fast on the OD version and it hits them on the way up so a lot of times the opponent is trying to guess and they're scared of your buttons or uh headbutt use this thing to swap them out of the sky just like you did before in season 1 uh OD headbuts or OD butt slime is really good but other than that uh I would only use butt slam as a combo Tool uh which will go over as well because you're going to want this move for its Oki uh yeah let's talk about the Oki now if you don't know what Oki means it means uh what to do after you knock the opponent down it's the whole mind game so we're plus 23 you don't don't know what that means it means that we have mad advantage and it's definitely our turn so I'm going to talk about the things we can do to mix up your opponent after butt SL there's a lot of things you can do here but what I personally use is just whiffing crouching light punch so do this do crouching light punch right away and you should be plus seven plus 7 and now the the following things I'm going to tell you are all auto timed okay so here we go so let's get Cammy to do wake up crouching light punch after she gets knocked down so she'll do just to show you that this is real and it's airtight the first thing is simply command grab so after a butt slam crouching light punch command grab and it'll beat them even if they press throw and even if they press uh crouching light punch I'll I'll get her to throw too just so you guys can see and I'll mess up there we go so it beats both options so that's great uh the next thing is obviously the opponent's going to get scared and they're going to try to jump out if you think they're going to jump or back dash then press heavy kick so I want to get Cammy to try to jump and heavy kick I think this is awesome because it's a really easy hit confirm when you hit them with this OD Sumo smash that doesn't combo OD Sumo Smash and you can do whatever followup you want so I'll show I'll show an example bam bam boom boom into hands or another butt slam boom boom but slime really really really good this is like the main thing I've been using when you press the heavy kick it should still beat their crouchy light punch and throw so it still beats it so it it'll cover a lot of options it'll beat them if they back dash if they press throw if they press crutch and light punch if they try to jump heavy kick is great but like I said if they're blocking command grab it's a it's a great 50/50 really really really good uh the next thing you can do if you want to play it a little safer you can press throw throw is you sacrifice some damage but you might get lucky and they'll try to jump straight up to punish you so let's get C they jump straight up they jump straight up and then you just hit heavy punch they're going to fall back over your head you're still at advantage and you just anti-air them um if you're really good I think you you can sneak in a charge there but like this but that but the only problem with that is I have to charge back and I back throw them I I don't really want to back throw them but that's that's an option there of course if they jump forward then you know you can't do anything so I just want to add the throw there because it's just a safer option if you want to try to get greedy and like I said the normal throw is going to beat uh I think the normal throw is going to lose their their throw because you're you're plus seven and this is five frames but so maybe the throw isn't the best but I'm just adding in there just so you know next is the shimmy uh this is mostly for or if you think your opponent's going to do a reversal or a drive reversal on wake up but you can still back walk shimmy this is really good because you can't do this on the dash forward like to say I did the dash forward Oki I can't back walk tamy is going to throw me every time so that's why making this like the crouching jab that I'm doing I think this is the best so crouching jab you press throw heavy punch they do reversal block it heavy punch they do super or dry reversal uh punish them really really good finally the last thing I know I'm adding a lot but I I feel like this butt SL thing is essential for Honda so it's good to know all your options uh you can do standing medium punch I think this is great as well so uh crouching light punch standing medium punch uh it's going to hit them uh you can do a variety of things from this I'm going to go over the medium punch soon but you can do something basic like you know just that combo uh standing medium punch Target combo light medium into headbutt or you can uh combo counter hit combo into your crouching strong like this bam there we go perfect uh so what the cool thing about sing medium punch as a mey is that if the opponent blocks and they don't do anything the cool thing is is that uh sing medum punch has plus one on block so you get one more turn so you get to blow them up if they try jump in or pressing a button cuz sing mean punch naturally on hit is plus six so if they try to jump out you still get your target combo anyways but if they block it then you got you can do something cheeky and go for a command grab you still get another turn which is great so that is pretty much the main things I did uh I do with the uh butt slam Oki really really good but it all starts with crouching light punch whiff and everything else is auto time okay uh how to get into the butt slam the main ways to get into butt slam is first just just doing your double lights all those crouching light punches really good anytime you land Crouch and light punches go into butt slam the only thing here problem is is that if the opponent's crouching this will not work unfortunately so if you if you if they're crouching then you have to go into headbut instead medium headbutt or you go into light hands the other way is from OD hands with the buff so every time you have the hand buff with Honda and you land OD hands from any way your plus enough where you can do Crouch and light punch and you don't have to worry about if they're crouching at that point so in that case you can go right into butt slam uh that way Sumo smash is another way so anytime you call the Sumo smash butt slam it's the exact same o key you go crouching light punch hold on let me make sure in case I'm wrong here uh it says plus six uh-oh uh-oh there we go sorry you got to do the you got do the butt slime right awayo I was about to say man we got to have to start over guys and yeah normal hand buff anytime you land normal hand buff for whatever you're doing if you recognize wait let's see if they're crouching here yeah if you recognize that they're standing then go for it with the hand buff let me see does the OD hand Buffs stand them up oh it doesn't okay so you have to recognize it on both damn all right enough about headbutt and butt slam let's talk about the meat and potatoes the buttons because Capcom wants Honda players to play more n they want you to walk around and give up your charge didn't work too well ccom but anyways yeah okay let's talk about um the standing medium punch this is Honda's most buffed button it's cracked it's super good so it's plus six on hit it's plus one on block and since it's so plus now uh you can naturally combo after it and on counter hit it's insane and it's got an insane hit box and they also made it uh Honda moves really forward like he's moving super forward during this and you can kind of press it forever you'll see a lot of Honda players just kind of mashing standing medium punch I don't recommend like mashing this point blank like this because if they do press a button you will get stuffed but at this kind of Sweet Spot range it's really good you'll get a lot of counter hits with this thing the opponent has to lab this and and know exactly how to stop it if you go for two reps but otherwise just throwing out is is really good uh in between using your your uh headbutts very scary okay so um the first thing about this is the the counter hit medium punch is really good so when anytime you land a counter hit and you will land a counter hit with this thing if you're close enough you can go directly in the crouching medium punch this is hella good like you go like this and then you drive Rush cancel easy confirm into the butt slam Oki um you can go into OD hands that's really really good if you have the uh the hand buff you know or if you just want to combo after like just going like this super sick and you go into the butt slam anyways and like I said I I mostly go into like when I see this I capitalize as much as I can and go into into drive Rush very very good and uh yeah don't forget this is cancelable too man like you can you can just simply cancel this into light hands at like max range I know 100 hand slap is minus on block but you can space it just going like this is really good good pressure I'm basically saying that like one of your key buttons with Honda standing Mee punch this is what they uh buff the most with Honda so you have to know all your options from it uh also if you Dy Rush cancel into it uh it's just really good plus five on block you can thread in the command grab like you just go straight into command man grab or you can go on block theand grab or you can go like this heavy kick if they're afraid and they try to jump they're going to get clipped by heavy kick and then you can go back into it back into OD Sumo Smash and boom boom now let's talk about the other good buttons for Honda so crouching light punch one of the best crouching light punches in the game for the range it has it's still four frames super fast you're going to use it to get people off of you you uh you can go into medium headbutt from it which is great damage from a light and you get a knockdown uh or you can go for hands too if you have the hand buff and of course it goes into butt slam but yeah your get off me move is crouching light Punch If you get a counter hit with this thing You' have to go into the target combo into whatever whatever you want to do next up is crouchy medium punch crouchy medium punch is really good as well the hit boox on this thing is uh insanely good like a lot of crutching me punches I use this as my uh whiff punish and drive Rush check button if someone is Drive rushing at you a lot with Honda uh which is crazy you know cuz you have headbutt but you know if someone is doing that and you want a button crouchy me punch is what I prefer I think this button is cracked it's slow cuz it's eight but since the range is so big you can press it as soon as you see the green as soon as you see the blue then green uh do crouching medium punch and then you go into all your your b&bs with punish wise once again uh you can buffer with this and you can drive Rush cancel it's just a good whiff punish button if you have charge you can go into headbutt from this like that standing Med kick this button is not used that much it has one specific use it's also hella slow dude it's 10 frames look at this thing this button is used to blow up up lows so a lot of people are going to be using crouchy Med kick on you a lot so with Honda you have to know this is your button to stop that and it's really Plus on hit so if you hit someone with this at least uh capitalize you can go into a headbutt uh if you already have charge or you can go into like hands counter hit you can go into the target combo or yeah crouching light punch Crouch light punch headbutt next button uh crouching mun kick yeah this button also a button that's barely never used but they made it now so that when you have the hand buff you can now cancel this in the 100 hand slap so now at least you have a super threatening low this is mostly important after uh his new followup after the hand buff we'll go over that in a little bit um all right you have to do the tarom to go into it right yeah uh when you dry Rush this thing uh it's it's mad plus so you can get some really good confirms with this like Drive rushing with someone with like low forward in the crouchy mean punch is hella good dude uh because Honda's dry Rush goes really far and it's pretty fast like it's it's a decent uh Drive rush so after you hit someone with headbutt maybe then you can at least threaten the low with it and of course the command grab see it's not bad even into standing medium punch otherwise um if you're right next to your opponent you hit with this thing Target combo or butt slam if they're standing or crutch and light punch headbutt down forward heavy kick is another great button uh it's a slow overhead you know it's 22 frames but you can really catch people off guard when they're so scared of the headbut and command grab so that when you're pressuring someone you can just throw this out and if you get a counter hit with this thing then you can know you can combo uh crutch and Light punch after it for example and then go into butt slam uh another obvious thing is that you can Cara cancel this so you can cancel this into a special move ideally you want to go into command grab so if the opponent Blocks Your standing medium punch you can kind of tick throw them this is especially good after like crossups like you go like this it's a great way to land your command grab even just walking forward and going into this is pretty strong it's a pretty strong mix uh if the opponent guess us wrong and tries to like press a button in between like I said uh the butt SL will naturally hit them another great use for it is when you're doing a drive rush if you go for a command grab directly you'll stop on a dime and lose all momentum but if you drive rush into down forward heavy kick you'll maintain your momentum so this is a kind of like a gimmick but it's great for closing rounds is that like when you're in a situation where you're trying to make a big comeback and you you go for a command grab you can go for one last Drive rush and use it all and just really surprise your opponent with the burst of speed and range uh of going into it so down forward heavy kick definitely has its uses forward heavy kick this is an essential button for Honda this is really important a lot of players are going to try to whiff punish you and walk away from you this is what you do to stop it because he's crouching heavy kick is stubby so when they walk away from you forward heavy kick is the way to go uh it hits the opponent low so therefore if they're walking backwards they cannot block it so uh obviously be careful it's on the slow side don't press it all the time but pay attention to how your opponent is uh playing against you and if you see them walk back bam di kills that move yeah I mean like I said adapt to how your opponent's playing in the in the lower ranks when people are are really D di crazy you don't need to use it as much but in in in the master ranks when people are more patient against Honda and they're fishing for perfect paries forward heavy kick shines more heavy punch another essential button for Honda this has really good priority it's also a really good anti-air and you'll get a mad reward for any kind of whiff punish what are you doing Cammy uh it'll put him in a crumple State and then from here you can dry Rush heavy punch uh close heavy punch and then go into your Sumo smash into all of your bnbs um if they're too far you can simply just do headbutt it's like your shimmy button too if you like walk forward and walk back if you have them in the corner you'll get some shimmies with this button let's talk about Sumo smash conversions now this move is really essential for Honda to land uh his biggest damaging combos to knock the opponent the air and it sets up his Oki afterwards too so I'm going to discuss how to land this thing or how I like to land it the first thing is obviously just jumping if you jump on your opponent and you land a hit uh great might as well go for maximum damage but one tip I can give here too is that um there'll be time someone's throwing like a Chun Le or someone is throwing a fireball you're really far away you can hit the tip of them with heavy kick and land the tip of your standing heavy kick like this and it'll combo so what you can do is something like hit him with the tip of this and boom you do Drive rush into heavy punch into Sumo Smash If you're looking for the hail Mar jump the UN good jump standing heavy kick standing heavy kick one hit will help and you know if you're too close you can recognize and and then do it that way yeah heavy punch punish counter we just went over that anytime you land uh a punish on somebody let's say you block a DP or something boom Drive Rush heavy punch again into Sumo smash or any type of shimmy heavy punch would be my go-to for for damage one hit any kind of combo uh so you got two routes you can pick let's say you go for sing medium Punch or crouching medium punch Drive rush you can either go heavy punch into Sumo smash that does 2009 or you can go Dy Rush standing medium punch one hit heavy kick into Sumo smash look like this that does a little more 20 39 but it's going to add scaling cuz it's more hits so whatever you prefer it's it's kind of depending on how many hits you did uh before how much damage you're going to get I usually just do standing heavy punch to keep it simple anytime you have a mix up and you have the opponent knocked down you're standing next to them a really easy confirm is just to press heavy kick like it's a it's like a good mey because it's two hits and it's cancelable on both hits so anytime you're in a situation where like the opponent's knocked down and you think they're going to try to jump out cuz they're scared of the command grab just press heavy kick and you have 10 years to confirm this into to sing heavy punch how bad is it on block all right I should go over that so on block uh it's minus5 and has mad push block they cannot punish this look how far they are you're out of standing light kick range so don't worry about it and I think it forces stand yeah it forces stand too that's the icing on the kick so standing heavy punch is just like a real sending heavy kick sorry is a really good kind of beginner getting started with Honda bun makes it really easy to confirm things like I said uh before they block a standing medium punch just throw out a heavy kick if they if they try to jump after this they try to jump see I just show you what it looks like I don't press anything C tries to jump out oh it hits they're on the ground and then when when you hit with this thing OD Sumo smash for meter efficiency you don't need to spend three bars Bam Bam into and then into the mix okay so we talked about how to get into the Sumo smash now let's talk about what to do after you land the hit so there's some key things that I go into first off obviously if you have the hands buff uh you can get some mad deeps where you go into the heavy enhanced hands and then you can go into head bot for for big damage if you want to cash out which you probably should I think you go into heavy head bot hold on a second let me let me make sure bam really really good or you can go to OD by slam so knock come down OD butt slam and then same thing you're you have Oki and you're right next to them uh just keep in mind this is this is like a lot of meter so like let's say you cancel you spend three bars you know and if you do the 100 hand slap another butt SL that's like five bars total so just manage your meter the next thing you can do is drive Rush heavy punch into uh Sumo Dash uh the chops this is really good for Corner carry you're giving up some damage but but I I feel like I'm winning a lot of my matches going for this first when I'm in midscreen I think pushing to the corner is a great idea uh and it makes your headbutts uh a lot scarier when the opponent is scared in the corner with mental Stacks so uh uh consider using that when you're midscreen and then obviously my favorite in goto is landing the butt slam because I want I want damage and I want Oki I want to keep them guessing right so anytime time you land this butt slam make sure you do it right away so you're plus 23 um if you want to get greedy and get a little extra damage a new buff in season too is you can dry Rush crouching medium punch into the butt slam which is nice but just know that you're not as the same frame Advantage as the previous one but it it has more Corner carry too which is great you're still plus 20 though you can make it work honestly that's that's pretty much what I do with with uh Sumo smash I mean it's haa guys it's uh he's definitely easy on the sauce since this is mainly a season 2 guide for Honda uh I should mention the new hand buff so when Honda does his Target combo he can now cancel the ending into his hand buff as you can see though it's minus 30 even on hit so the way ccom wants you to set this up is after a Sumo smash so after a Sumo smash you go dry rush into the target combo standing medum punch down forward heavy kick and you press down heavy kick and then what happens is you're standing really close to them just outside of throw range at plus 13 and you have a hand buff on stock ready to rock and roll which is really really good so one example of something you can do is you can go like this hand buff walk forward and then threaten uh a crouching medium kick into Target combo or uh since you'll have the hand buff you can just go into 100 hand slabs so something like this that and then cash out with a headbutt for example I don't think like being plus 13 here is not bad especially when you have the hand buff and you can even go for command grab too like that that's not bad but it's a lot of it you have to eyeball for one cuz you're only plus 13 like I can't like whiff a button and perfectly time it so one part is you have to eyeball it and the second part is I just feel like the reward is not as crazy good as just doing the butt slam and getting damage and then going from there but since you do have the hand buff uh even if you guess wrong and you don't open them up that way at least you get the hand buff too so it's your preference I just personally didn't use it uh much with Honda I feel like it was just too limited but if anyone has any great ideas that you can do with it you know go ahead and leave a comment below um as for the the Sumo smash like the chop moves um don't forget that the OD version is Plus on block like you're plus two so like just throwing it out every now and then just like I don't know going crushing Mee punch is just going like this is great for uh just winning neutral uh with Honda it just cost Meir to do that you could do something cheeky and just do the normal one the normal one is minus it's minus three but you can you can gamble and frame trap them with the last hit and hit them I don't recommend doing this I think this is pretty gimmicky and really risky for the reward but in a clutch situation where you're like in Burnout or or you're low on meter and you need to get it back you can go for this if you want so I I I'll show Camy doing Crouch and light punch so you can see how it works so cam does a hit here Bam Bam and it'll hit her it'll frame trap her uh you can also go for a cheeky perfect Parry too cuz you're minus three it's not punishable but this is really dangerous to do cuz your opponent is in throw range so keep that in mind when you're in Burnout though this really shines um now you're plus one you do something like this like that now there is a gap here after the light punch and going back into it there's a gap but it's a it's a good way to mix up your opponent and uh pressure them and push them to the corner when they're in Burnout it's not bad keep that in mind all right bonus stuff what else can I what else did I use I can help you guys with uh oh safe jump setup okay when you land Sumo Smash in the corner with this guy uh you can do Drive Rush heavy kick so you go like this Dy Rush heavy kick two hits into heavy headbutt and you're plus 42 safe jumps even with Honda I think you should really consider this any time you land uh Sumo Smash and it's really low cost it's only one drive bar and a save jump with Honda is really scary because you know he's a brawler and he's got a command grab so check that one out another cool bonus tip if you knock someone down in the corner there'll be that 50/50 situation where they might jump and you can go for a meaty you can also go for a crouching medium kick in the corner which is really nice cuz it hits low and you can do this fancy clap combo where you can go crouching light punch into clap or sing Light punch into clap after your crouching medium kick and that leaves you at plus seven and then you can do your standing Target combo light punch medium punch uh into medium headbutt so it look like this and it'll leave you perfectly at plus 42 which is another safe jump I love safe jumps so that's why if you if you do the heavy headbutt it'll be plus 41 which is still technically a safe jump just not against uh five framer so light versions of uppercuts so that's a great setup in the corner too okay last bonus tip the grand finale the most sauciest of sauce if you want extra Saucy or Honda the side switch combo this is really sick okay anytime you land Sumo smash but obviously ideally if you're in the corner you want to drive Rush heavy kick two hits and dry Rush cancel it again into sweep I know hear me out but check this out and it hits him it hits him with the back of the sweep and knocks him in the air for a side switch and you can even go into Super from this bam and it'll strike so much fear in your opponent you're like this your opponent will be like this Honda is on another level another thing you can do is you can do light hands if you have level three as well and level three them and a side switch on top of that this is really fun to do obviously it's really expensive but I think this is a legit side switch and you're going to need you're going to need this you're going to need to know this uh it's really like if if if they di you you know bam okay and that's it that's a wrap that's my uh that's my Honda guide uh I know I it it didn't sound like I taught much but I mean Honda is a simple character guys what do you want from me I'm sure people in the comments will uh add a whole bunch of of tips which would be nice so that when I play Honda again I can learn some new stuff but um yeah man Honda is tough to win with in master rank like I said uh you really got to use those headbutts at the right range and really understand all your OKO butt slams but hopefully this helped a fellow Honda player out there and don't forget if you guys have any extra questions or anything you leave in a comment below or visit my stream I stream every single day I'm easy to find best bur twitch.tv check it out we also play retro but uh yeah and we've played a whole bunch of characters from this point so the next guide we're doing is zangie I think and I'll continue to release more guides as we level up more characters through the upper Master ranks so thanks for watching say goodbye Chad bye-bye yep don't forget to drive
