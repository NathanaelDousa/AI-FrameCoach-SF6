yo okay it's show can you the way to Glory first made a gigle made Ackle my me like a n i me like a pickle neutral the stage of a fight where neither player is blocking or getting hit by anything and you're trying to figure out the best way to start or continue your game plan footsies a complicated often nebulous term that refers to the battle for controlling the space in front of you often by using good pokes in essence you're trying to get to a range you like while trying to deny your opponent getting to a range that they like a wise man once said footsies are a part of neutral but not all neutral has footsies even in a neutral there's an unspoken rule that enforces rock paper scissors like decision-making when fish for an advantage this subtle phenomenon is usually what can Define matchups since there are a myriad of tools that exist among different characters defining their archetypes but you could say that in the case of blanca we Define him as well weird all right Blanca isn't all that weird sure he likes to do the funny Blanca thing with his Blanca balls surprise attacks like Amazon River Run and wild Hunt throwing out Blanca Chand dolls etc etc but in order for these Dynamic tools to be sharpened for consistency in battle you have to understand is neutral all right let's start small Blanca by Design is a high-risk H War character who excels in mobility and trickiness to confuse and overwhelm his opponent the goal is simple be as annoying as humanly possible depending on your opponent results May Vary on both ends sometimes you have to play slow and other times you have to turn up the heat with aggression knowing how to switch between the two will only better your element of surprise in the new now there's a really good video explained in layman's terms by content creator katoa where he summarizes What's called the three structure a concept of neutral documented and described in full by top Guilty Gear player machabo I'll link both the article and summary video in the description basically it goes like this there's passive play establishing play and preemptive play when playing passive you're usually functioning at a slower and reactive Pace to shut down your opponent's various options this becomes easier at moderately safer ranges if your opponent is just fishing for hits using their own tools but it gets harder when the Gap is too close enter establishing play well someone has to make a move to get the party started right if a player has access to moves within an effective range that benefits them whether it be zoning Rush down or otherwise they can establish set attacks to force a response from their opponent who is looking for opportunities to win neutral [Applause] sometimes those attacks are reactable sometimes not so much so what can you do well if you have an assumption or read that your opponent will try to establish a play in the neutral you can go for a counter that's necessary for discouraging the option to be seen again therefore attempting to maintain the neutral in your favor we call this preemptive play now remember what I said about that unspoken rule of RPS and neutral well if you're the one playing preemptive trying to shut down what's perceived as an assumption of established play and the player pulls back their punches in that moment then guess what you're now losing to passive play this neutral triangle is always being cycled Whenever there is no op or pressure being applied and both characters have an opportunity to overthrow the other whether you like it or not this is neutral all right now with that out the way let's go over Blanca's neutral the ranges that you're going to want to reserve for setting up different plays is entirely dependent on the scenario if not the match up itself when playing passive and fighting against a character who was on par with their tier of buttons focusing on footsies is an option in the Playbook again where you position yourself will depend on the matchup but in the context of footsies you usually find yourself anywhere from within Crouch medium punch range to outside of Crouch heavy punch range you won't need to depend on charge too much if you have Drive meter to spare while also capitalizing on an opponent whiffing with cross medum punch DRC cancels St medum punch into sa1 or sa3 or punishing wider whiffs with cross heavy Punch or cross heavy kick for Oki opportunities it's also worth noting that if you're sitting on a huge life lead most of the time you're better off just relying on your grounded light attacks to control the screen and allow the opponent to establish in areas where your mental stack won't be as cluttered now let's say you're the one establishing to get the party started well one good thing about s of6 is that every character has access to at least one establishing tool that's right Drive Rush obviously some Drive rushers are better than others his Drive Rush is very underrated for what it can accomplish in neutral Drive Rush St heavy kick is basically a giant wall being flung at the opponent making it hard to check with regular normals you also have a bunch of special moves to test the opponent's defensive Tendencies like Blanca ball Rainbow Ball surprise hop Amazon River Run and wild Hunt you don't want to go too ham with these techniques however as all of these tools can be considered very risky on paper but when used correctly these tools can overwhelm even the sharpest of Defense [Music] Blanca being preemptive with his neutral plays also depends entirely on the matchup and What scenario he finds himself in this includes jumping or sliding under a fireball as a [Music] read aning certain establishing air approaches or even shutting down potential momentum shifts during the sequence just keep in mind the type of risk you're implying at certain levels of play as this can sometimes be seen as establishing to the opponent who's already prepared to counter time over so why is this all important well like kraa said in his video it's important to understand the variables and how neutral is presented from both players how you adapt to the situation won't always be the same when fighting another player and that's what makes the concept of neutral so interesting it's like a small conversation between two people in the form of a dance playing chess yelling and screaming at each other I don't know it's also important to keep in mind that since this is essentially RPS coded you should understand when to keep playing the same hand versus when to switch it up newer players usually struggle when adapting on a fly while season players will not only adapt quicker but can also fool you into a mental trap of their own testing the high level Waters you guys are both playing the same game after all so to summarize footsies are a part of neutral but not all neutral has footsies neutral has RPS elements of its own and it's necessary to understand what beats what passive beats preemptive establishing beats passive preemptive beats establishing note due to match of variables results May Vary Blanca is highrisk high reward by nature and sometimes has to establish in ways that bit the passive opponent just don't be too predictable you'll be fine all right y'all and that's it for the video holy [ __ ] all right y' that's it for the video if you like what you saw make sure to rock pap siss is that like button consider subscribing comment all that good stuff and I'll catch youall on the next one y'all take it
