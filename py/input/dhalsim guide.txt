yo what's going on everyone today I'm going to be giving you some tips with dolom just to improve you know your doulam and improve as a player improve your strategy or whatever so first one I'll go over is um using more faints when you're zoning or you're throwing fireballs so what I mean is when you're poking boom boom is to is to throw faints out like that because usually when you play good players a lot of doulsons are very predictable with their poking like they'll go back to back to back to back and they catch on to your timing and most of the time they will perfect par you or they'll look to whiff punish but if you're unpredictable with the way that you poke it makes it very hard for the opponent to get a read on on how you play it's also good to get them to tap parry too if they like the perfect parry um limbs cuz as you as you see here if he taps parry and I don't hit him it's really good at like draining draining their bar the next one I'll go over is um using using your light kick more this button is really really [ __ ] good it's very very good i like to use it like when I'm poking if I'm if I'm poking at my opponent boom i like to just chuck it out like that and the the reason I'm the reason I'm saying light kick is because this button's got really good recovery so if I whiff this and they jump you have enough time to anti-air there's kind of like a OS with it throw a limb out you can whiff that and you have enough time to anti-air so it's got really good recovery see but the pro the problem with it is though is that you don't really deal you don't really deal enough damage so you don't want to be doing it the whole game though because people are just going to keep doing it until it [ __ ] up somehow and then they get in so you do want to look look for more drive rush checks with back medium kick and crouching hard punch but this is a good one this is a good one still to use next one I'll go over is um Dawson's throw loop dawson has got a throw loop in this game if you get a throw in the corner and then you last slide you can throw again you can down throw to whatever i'll set Ryu to I'll set Ryu to mash on wake up boom there's also options to cover like if they hold up on wake up or they or they jump out so what you do is is when you throw When you go for your throw do a quarter circle back motion so you slide throw quarter circle back motion throw quarter circle back motion what that will do is if they neutral jump or they forward jump you can do another quarter circle back motion into punch and it will and a level two will come out a vertical jump of your like that see so I've done a quarter circle back motion during the throw and if I've seen the jump so I'll do another quarter circle back motion and then and then a punch and if they jump out the corner it it auto corrects too so like that it also works with level one too you just got to do quarter circle forward instead of quarter circle back all right next one I'll go over is um this is kind of like a [ __ ] abstract concept with Doulam i know I tried to sound smart there and hopefully it's the right word but you know what I mean so when when we're at this range and we're poking or whatever and the opponent is closing space like they will they will dash up they will dry rush or whatever like and they're here listen even though Doulam is a slow card and he can't do [ __ ] bro instead of retreating and and playing like a [ __ ] bro go go go go go towards them like at this range drive rush jab get in force some mix because when someone cuz the way people play against Doulam is their mindset is so different they're so worried about getting in most of the time and walking forward and looking for ways to get in that um their mental stack is not really on all right I'm going to I'm going to sit and I'm going to [ __ ] check I'm going to check this i'm going to check a dry rush or whatever so you'll catch a lot of people off guard most of the time like coming in i'll I'll throw some clips up like on screen like I know the quality is really [ __ ] but that's the only way I could [ __ ] show it yoga [Music] fire with you all right next one I'll go over is um using more back hard kick as an anti-air this back this anti-air is actually elite this is lowkey Dam's best anti-air i see too many sim plays they only use back medium punch and then they always ask why they're always getting jumped in on so I've set DJ to jump and if I do back medium punch look how much damage that does and that does [ __ ] all damage it's not bad because you can cancel it in the flame or whatever but it doesn't knock down it only resets them in the air and it doesn't really discourage the opponent from jumping they're going to keep jumping in they'll they'll take this four or five times and if they get one jump in they take half your life off so using back hard kick is good cuz when you most of the time like when they jump in with the button you'll get a counter hit and you knock them down and that'll discourage them less from jumping in on you if you knock them down cuz you'll be able to knock them down set up set up some pressure or whatever you know you can also you can also teleport too if you're fast enough you see you you you can you can get a meaty teleport arthur too so but and if you really if you're really like that I'm not like that you can also do ex blast like that but that's for like you [ __ ] sweaty cards bro all right next one I'll go over is uh confirming your lights into super this is a very very important thing you need to learn with Sim if you want to level up or you know go higher in your rank it's super super important so most of Doulson's combos they start off lights and the problem with it is that they require a lot of meter so for example like this the these are like his bread and butters like see I just use [ __ ] three bars or you do like that into that uses two bars so you'll always um go into burnout a lot if you rely on those so being able to uh cancel your lights straight into level one is very very strong and something you should practice just to avoid you know just to have better media management and avoid going into burnout you'll use it a lot when you're approaching someone and you're trying to catch them low like to catch them walking back so If I go like that just to catch him low or or off a drill kick when you when you get a meaty drill kick you use it a lot like that too so yeah that's something you should practice
