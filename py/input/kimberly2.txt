what's good people today we're going to be talking about Kimberly in this video I want to help beginners get into the character I know Kimberly can seem very intimidated with like the bombs and just how many moves she has one stop cancels and just very tricky things but ultimately kimbery is quite simple on surface level it's only when you start really getting into the tech that she can become very Tech heavy and just input heavy and mind game heavy but on a surface level she's very fun to pick up very easy to pick up um she has a few strong buttons can throw out there so I want to just cover like a few things that I think beginners will find helpful do me a favor like comment subscribe likeing will help with the algorithm subscribing will help me with the channel and commenting will kind of help me gauge if you like this sort of content so let's get into the video all right so I want to just firstly look at this costume all right we're going to take off we're going to take off the hood cuz we need to see this costume in full Glory like what look at this costume all right so so kimbery is a very fast moving character that can really mix you up her mix-up potential is very very good she does struggle on on kind of wake up situations so like if you knock her down you can bully her because she does not have an ex reversal wake up she has a level one wake up um but this is kind of not real cuz if you do a mey attack like a light on mey on wake up on your Oki if I do level one you're going to block it so or you can Parry so her level one's is kind of viable but it's also not viable if you're aware of the situation the only viable wake up is level three so kind of on defense kimbly can can kind of be lacking at times but I think she kind of mix for it with her offense so I want to talk about her top five M and neutral so her best button without a doubt is standing medium kick this is her Undisputed best button standing medium kick has decent range special cancelable um drivew cancelable as well so kind of it has everything this move is very very good second move I want to talk about is low forward so low forward is actually plus one block but let's set the Dommy to block you can see she's plus one on block very good move it's just kind of a low poke sadly you can't drive Rush cancel from it or special cancel from it now I would like kimbley to be able to special cancel from this or at least Drive Rush from it that might be asking for too much but I think you know Kim's low threat isn't that that deep like she has good lows and stuff but I I think really you can walk kimbery back without any any trouble really um but it's still regardless a good move very very good quick poke and it's plus one I I I think a lot of people still don't know that it's plus one so especially for beginner level you're going to be able to leverage this move quite a bit it's you know it's fast poke it's a low and it's plus um so generally lows aren't really plus so the fact that this is a low and it's plus is very nice so that was that move I want to talk talk about standing heavy kick so this is plus two on block and you can fish for trades or counter hits with this move again it's just a very good move um not much to say really it's just a plus FR move that you can easily access the only issue I would say is that the range isn't that great you know look at this so all it is a good move though especially on Oki very nice move so that's that move I want to talk about standing like kick cuz I feel like standing like kick does not get enough love and attention because it's five frames it has very good range like look at look at the range for a light attack it's it's actually very good so I think this movie is very underrated and also if you whiff punish so like if for example Kimberly does I don't know if if if they whiff a button and it and it's on punish counter well you can do this but you can also do the medium elbow which is which is this and that has good Oki but you can do this and no matter the range you will always get this as a punish let's try and do this at max range so that was kind of max range so see max range and it's still a combo so I would say standing light kick is very good and very underrated so the final move I want to talk about is crouching heavy punch now this move is excellent because it can be used defensively and offensively so for defense you would use this for anti- aing it's a great anti-air button and you can you can use the Sprint to mix them up see see so there's a lot of stuff you can do with this jump you can mix them up you can stay on the same side you can do this and throw uh from antier obviously so I want to talk about not it's use in neutral it's a neutral but it's also from system mechanics so I want to talk about Drive rush so if you do Drive Rush on block this move is really nice because it opens up strike throw pressure like it's so good so okay she's plus two here on Drive Rush it's it's just sick like immediate throw timing or mids like there's so much stuff you can do from this and then also if you burn ex she's going to be plus one so I think this move is really good for Run Stop pressure so the reason why this move is good is because in Burnout she will be plus two as well now adding Drive rush into that she's plus six so I think this move is very good burning ex as well should be plus five um normally she will be plus one so if she blocks this she'll be plus one same with Drive should be plus two oh let me do it normally y plus two if you burn ex plus five so you know there's a a lot of stuff where you can kind of alter the frames and really mess up the opponent's defensive options using this move so yeah standing heavy punch is very good now I want to talk about just B&B combos real quick just to get you started with combos you can do this as like a with punish this does not work as a combo you would have to do something like something like this and that's why a lot of Kimberly players just do this on block like just randomly it's because it's I mean this is kind of a mixup on block you can option select but then I can do nothing and then catch you with like a drivew button so really it is a mixup on block this um this kind of empty Sprint move cuz hold on let me get her away from me so this Sprint kind of St is kind of a stance and you can do empty stance and she will do those two kind of run back flip kicks so you can do Sprint cancel overhead or you can do the slide so she has a lot of fundamental moves from from this stance The Stance is is fundamental to Kimberly's game plan and the fact that you have another option that is a mixup on block is very good as well I mean you can interrupt it with an ex attack so it's not free but uh yeah it's still very good to makes the opponent up but we're going to talk about B&B combos she also has free frame confirms so there's a lot of moves uh you know you can confirm a lot easier with Kimberly than a lot of characters I think in my opinion anyway um she just has a lot you can do and then like I would do something like okay so from this I would do that's something that you can do as well it's kind of cheap like it's kind of it's kind of flow chart but a lot a lot of players still don't know how to do with that move you just jab you literally just jab it but a lot of players like try and do like DPS Kim is sick man all right so let's talk about real BBS I just talked about light confirm so you can confirm like light shoulder and then this leaves home range for a tick throw so there's no like walk forward required it's always going to be in tick range unless you do like like now she's not going to be take full range so like yeah if it's if it's like a max range attack like this for example she's not going to be in tick throw range but if you do it from like here tick throw range so her light confirms get her kind of elbow or tattoo and I like to use tattoo if I want to build a bit of space usually people will back R there so like for example here get a bit of space throw a bomb down you know maneuver neutral reset neutral and this is very good for building space and this is good for continuing pressure for kind of a strike throw mixup in this situation because if you do elbow light elbow on Block it's kind of a strike throw mixup cuz she's left in range for a throw or people like sometimes like to mash that cuz they don't want to take whatever it is you're going to do next so you can kind of confirm and then that brings me on to her kind of main confirm which is Crouch medium punch Target combo and then whatever special you want to do so slide is good to continue Oki and pressure so so that you can do that uh you can do this you can also do this as well which is loopable and in the corner you can get elbow but that's just something to keep in mind cuz this does more damage so if you do that and then this in the corner it does more damage than doing the kick from it and also I forgot to mention you can do the same OK as well so it kind of Loops yeah so that's that combo so again I'll show you again you can do pretty much everything other than like heavy elbow that doesn't work you can do uh light elbow into like super medium elbow for Oki or Sprint stance for additional Oki slide now that only works from I believe yeah from if you do like Target combo and then you do a Target get combo Drive rush you can do that but this doesn't work normally so you would have to do like I don't know it only works in this situation just something to keep in mind if you want to go for like something like that uh yeah it's you can't do it but yeah that's her kind of mid Target combo confirm I would say now one of the best moves that she has is low forward you can combo from it because it's plus five so you can either do this or you can do you can still do this light kick both work because it's plus five on hereit this is four frames this is five frames so they will both combo just hope to keep in mind and actually I would would kind of opt for standing light kick cuz as you can see like if you do that on block and one of them hits you can still be in range whereas like jab is going to whiff here see yeah both Jabs are going to whiff and then if you do light kick you know you can kind of fish for uh you know for a light confirm so yeah I think optic for light kick is probably your best bet in this situation so that's low forward now standing heavy kick you can get Target combo so overhead would be plus four on hit so you can only get Crouch jab cuz the these two moves are five frames so this is her only full frame button so yeah you can only get don't like that in the corner um keep in mind that you can do this and it's plus eight on hit and you would think you can get this but you can't it just whiffs so yeah we yeah you can't do it so or this so you would have to do Straight Target combo or like stunning medium kick but I think I don't recommend that I would say do Target combo uh cuz it does more damage so yeah that is what you would do from overhead we have standing heavy kick which I showed before you would just do Target combo I guess like on Drive rush you can do more stuff but I would say do Crouch heavy punch after Drive rush because firstly it does more damage than stand heavy punch but also you can get the heavy elbow whereas now if you do Target combo you no longer have access to the heavy elbow which is good for Oki and good for damage so I think the highest damage potential definitely is crouching heavy punch because look so that's something you can't do with Target combo so I would stick to crouchy heavy punch so yeah those are just a few tips and tricks with Kimberly I didn't want to go too much in detail because you can get complicated and she has a lot of tech she has a lot of flow charts she has a lot of optimal combos that you can do very flashy combos uh like one that I'll show you is like uh Aid switch combo now a beginner wouldn't re I wouldn't really tell a beginner to do stuff like that this is like Kimberly main stuff you know so like if you did it in a combo yeah and that's a side switch as well so if you slightly this is what I'm saying she can get super complicated and I don't want to make it too intimidating for you know beginners to pick her up so but those are just a few tips and tricks let me turn off she was she was she was vibing but yeah those are a few tips and tricks about kimy as I said she can get very very technical and I don't want to overwhelm beginners picking up the character I went over some strategies in neutral best move to use a neutral I tend to do like top five moves in neutral with uh beginner guides because it's like easy way to pick up Kimberly just some simple b&bs and uh that's about it really you know when you understand Combos and you understand how to use them in neutral I think personally that's enough to pick up the character now if you want to make the decision to take her a bit more seriously I have some guides on you know o key set up how to use the bombs in neutral how to use the bombs in o key definitely more in depth guides on my channel but this was just something simple hope you enjoyed peace
