I'm going to be breaking down a couple of Lily's best normal and special moves and modern controls to help you out if you're just starting everything here can be done in classic as well but seeing as modern supplies the character a bit I'll always recommend them to beginners if you're confused by any of the concepts I bring up be sure to check out my guide the absolute basics of Street Fighter despite being so small Lily's clubs give her some huge pokes a great one to start out with is her stand medium attack it's her longest range normal attack and it lets you bully your opponent from really far away use it plenty to stop your opponent from walking at you carelessly if you use for medium enough your opponent will probably try to jump at you Lily is equipped with a very solid anterior though in her forward special attack she shoots up at a diagonal to snipe people jumping from afar but be warned that if they're jumping right over your head forward special might miss but in most situations you'll be able to knock them out of the sky no problem when your opponent gets past your pokes Lily still has some great close range options her sand light attack will have her do a quick knee and then if you keep pressing she'll then use her clubs and push the opponent away but the lights push her opponent away on hit or block if they block too much you can switch your neutral special this is called a command grab and it works similarly to a normal throw with more damage and it'll throw your opponent all the way across the screen at a basic level you can just use the space to go back to poking from far away with your medium attack if you've watched any Lily players before you've probably seen her flying across the screen all the time while that is one of her defining tools I think you should focus on the fundamentals I've introduced first before you get into that it's best to start simple with fighting games and Lilies win stocks and how they interact with their spiers might be a bit too much to think about at the start once you feel comfortable with your posts and antiers you can look into Lily's other tools and add them one by one the key is to go at your own pace and limit the amount of new info you've taken at once so you don't get overwhelmed if you do have any questions about the stuff I brought up about Lily here or anything else about her feel free to comment or tune in to one of my streams I can try to help you out there hope you have fun playing Lily and I'll be back with more guides soon
