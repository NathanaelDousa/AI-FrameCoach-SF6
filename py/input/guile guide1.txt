what up guys in this video I'll be teaching you guys bread and butter combos that you'll be using the most in actual matches punish counter conversions and overall fundamentals of using a Charged character these are the essential things you'll need to know to use gal effectively and efficiently this video is aimed for players wanting to learn how to use GAO but it also teaches you skills that'll cross over to any other charged character this is episode 1 so leave a like if you want more videos like this first I want to embed this rule in your head this is super important when you're learning a Charged character and that rule is the ABCs always be charging gal is a character that was built to control the pace of the match with his booms so one of the main ways that opponents will get in on you is jumping so this rule will help you always be ready to anti-air develop the habit of going back into charging whenever you finish a sonic boom or a flash kick and putting back or down back immediately will make sure you'll store enough charge for the next move getting into the habit of this early on will also help you execute your combos more consistently since some strings will require you to charge during inputs the next topic is how to execute a perfect bloom or a flash kick I'll be going over the inputs what the difference is and how it could be useful to execute a perfect special you have to press the attack button and the last input motion at the exact same time for example holding back to charge of Sonic then pressing forward and punch at the same time will perform a perfect Sonic Boom same thing with a flash kick pressing the ending up input along with the kick button will perform a perfect flash kick the main difference between a non-perfect special and a perfect special is a damage a perfect Sonic Boom does 50 more damage and a perfect flash kick does 200 more damage that's a lot of damage to leave on the table if you don't get it perfect some combo strings can only be done if a perfect Sonic is executed since it gives one extra frame of hit Advantage this game rewards players who take the time to practice and perfect their execution before I go into the bread and butter combos just keep in mind that you'll mostly be performing these combos when you land a jump attack since Kyle's main offense comes from Sonic booms as you can see these are mostly one to three hit conversions and the pushback from The Flash kick is far to allow GAO to return back to the main strategy the standing medium punch to crouching medium punch combo to flash kick requires you to input your charge right away after the first medium punch in the standing medium punch to Heart punch Target combo can take a bit of practice to get down consistently but the damage payout is worth it foreign has so many options that does a decent amount of damage on block sweeps or with punishes that is kind of crazy these are some of the ones that you'll have a lot of opportunity to do so make sure you get this down staying aware of the pop-ups on the side that let you know if it's a counter hit or punish counter hit will help you convert more consistently make sure to charge for a flash kick right after the light Sonic Blade timing is more strict but does a decent amount of damage nice and simple two hit combo but you have to get a perfect flash kick to get the most out of it all right remember you're a God player now everyone will jump that's the nature of the matchup lucky for you Kyle has some decent anti-airs to alleviate some pressure of having to always hold a charge while these aren't the greatest anti-air buttons they're enough to stop some from jumping they sometimes trade in the crouching heart punch can sometimes lose against jumping attacks but it gets the job done we covered a lot today and this is only the beginning once you learn one charged character the easier it gets to learn the others before I wrap this up I want to say thank you to everyone who's been supporting me here on YouTube I want to continue these five minute episodes but if you want a longer format let me know in the comments below again if you like this video and found it helpful please leave a like and sub to the channel it would mean a lot to me I also stream live on Twitch if you want to ask me anything while I'm live or you can join the Discord and play some games with us alright guys thanks again for watching ggs and I'll see you later peace [Music] hello [Music] exercise will you take me to a place around we can't let go
