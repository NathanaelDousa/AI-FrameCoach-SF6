what is going on my dudes One Step here with the ultimate beginner's guide for Luke in Street Fighter 6. going over some tips and tricks best strategies and of course some simple fun easy combos to get you started today [Music] make sure you subscribe for more fun fighting game content and let's get right into it so the first thing you need to take note of is Luke is a very in your face kind of fighter you'll see here a lot of the simple combos just bring you closer to your opponent even the medium one here we're just in our opponent's face now though we do have sandblast to keep our opponent away at medium range and a good anti-air when they jump in we're all about getting in there and doing some damage a big note for Luke is notice that a lot of his special moves that are enhanced we have this one right here but you'll notice you can actually spend an extra meter of your drive meter to do more damage so we'll do this we use an extra meter you see that there and a lot of special moves have that ability so even our Rising uppercut here it is simple we can use an extra meter and slam dunk them but again we use an extra meter so the reason why I'm bringing that up is because you only have six pieces for your drive meter and Luke is gonna burn through them like no other so really make sure you watch that keep an eye on that because you do not want to burn out keep in mind your Avenger special move your kind of football tackle move here that is actually full screen so because Luke is an in your face kind of character when your opponent is trying to play keep away even full screen you can use this move and it hits them not only that it's an overhead so it's a great option to get in there if they're blocking low and the enhanced version gains armor on the run up allowing you to close the distance and do some damage the Luke's bread and butter starters for you are going to be your low medium kick here and your jump in medium kicks that's an overhead and a good cross-up as well and those two moves actually go together very well so you can jump in medium kick then low medium kick into a special or even a super so for a quick example you see there we would overhead low mixed them up went into enhanced special move and then another special move so I'd recommend a lot of the time going for that low medium kick or that jump in medium because that's gonna be a good cross-up for you going to low and then whatever you want to do from there that's a good bread and butter not only that but another bed and butter you got is your low light kick into your light punch now to start slow it's two hits and it goes into any special or super so for example get down and again I want to repeat that though Luke is an in your face kind of character the sandblast is really good you're keeping your opponent away keeping them on their toes make them want to jump and then when they do when they jump over them Rising uppercut three out of rate your best cross spin the game for Luke's gonna be your jumping medium kick cross them up then go into something another thing to keep in mind is Luke's light combo the three punches you're gonna see here that is cancelable into any special and or super so you can jump in with that Medium kick going for the three hit punch go to a super or even just a special move with that being said your medium combo here the four hits though it looks like they're following that one as far as I see not a lot of things can hit after that so I would recommend if you want to continue it sticking with your light combo here the three hit punches now though your Ford heavy two punch combo here looks countable even if you don't get anything after it it does pretty dang good damage for just simple two hits the best strategy that I can recommend for Luke as a beginner is keep them away with sandblast and then as they jump into your anti-air here then when they get in your face with that low medium kick into anything because even that alone that four hits pretty dang good but you see here that four hits with an enhanced does almost the same as just two heavy punches you're gonna trade off what do you want to do in what situation now some fun and easy combos it can get you started today as a beginner for Luke or as follows of course you're jumping medium down medium into anything special is going to be a good bread and butter for anything that you want to do now if you're gonna be in the corner as we all know a great option is your drive impact if you want a combo off of your drive impact what I recommend doing is your back medium punch into a special like so [Applause] you can of course just do your four two heavy punch get off that's pretty good if you have a lot of meter and you want to be flashing you can go ahead and do your Rising uppercut you need to burn it twice though again it's flashing does pretty good damage I wouldn't recommend it because you're going to burn through your meter like crazy your three light punch combo again goes into any special that you want so you can jump in with a medium if you want to start it that way but again the three light punch combo goes in any special and you can meet or burn that if you wish to now your flash knuckle and hand special this one right here it's a double hit uppercut that's a great option if you want to go into any super even mid screen even your three super art as well I hope this video helped you start your journey with Luke in Street Fighter 6. if you found it helpful make sure to give it a thumbs up let me know down below
