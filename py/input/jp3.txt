welcome to part two of my JP guide this video will be covering his General game plan combos pressure setups some matchup tips and resources this video expects you to know what JP's moves do so if you need a refresher on that go check out part one the primary goal of Street Fighter 6 is to remove the opponent's Health before they remove your health the secondary goal is to get them to the corner before they get you to the corner while still having the resources necessary to pressure them a common misconception is that JP wants to stay at full screen at all times in order to maintain an advantageous position however this is not the case at all as JP has powerful neutral pokes for midscreen and a dangerous Corner game instead JP creates space in order to inch his weight of the corner whilst being outside of the opponent's most threatening range your goals depend on the matchup a fast character is going to have an easy time getting in and thus taking up screen space becomes less of a priority a slow character on the other hand must be kept outside of your range as long as you can allow them to be JP should prioritize portal and frame traps on offense and should play very safe on defense using Amnesia sparingly to seal your turn now for a few tips buffering standing heavy punch and a light Fireball is a really good strategy at all levels of play the string creates plenty of push back on block and allows the portal to be set up on hit portals make JP's next neutral interaction easier as the opponent is forced to either try and hit you to remove the portal or stay in place to block the portal JP can use the portal for a safe approach the light portal gives JP a shield protecting him at his current position where the heavy portal gives JP the greatest room to advance while leaving him vulnerable until he gets under the portal the medium portal is a good happy medium between the two lastly don't use your zoning tools too much as their slow startup makes them able to be punished heavily on whiff the combo section of the guide and most of the setup section will not be commentated but feel free to pause to read any notes I put on the bottom half of the screen I also will be color coding notation here's a guide and with that let's take a look at some of JP's combos [Music] [Music] not that no away youj do do [Music] we to carear about this [Music] [Music] [Music] I present you [Music] [Music] you think [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you this [Music] [Music] [Music] all right back to the commentary 's a chart detailing what you can do after the heavy kick heavy punch Target combo [Music] tree glav has 10 active frames making it a great option to use on your opponent's wake up using it after a throw makes it plus un block and it leads to a ton of damage on hit it's pretty easy to hit [Music] confirm make sure that the opponent is high up when you level one otherwise the setup won't work this pressure sequence of the unblockable by the community is entirely gapless meaning that the opponent cannot Parry after the initial hit thus forcing them to guess high low the string also has overheads and lows that hit very close to each other making it extremely difficult to block people will not be blocking this at most levels of play the sequence only works in the corner against most of the casts as the opponent falls out of the overhead Fireball against tall characters this sequence works at any distance it can also be done midscreen after Drive rush back medium punch due to its low push back and frame Advantage the sequence is not impossible to block just pretty hard it can also be driver reversal out of this block string works on any character midscreen but is less consistent as the jumping heavy punch needs to be timed depending on character height this is a newly discovered gapless block string that works on any character midscreen [Music] if the sweep connects JP can set up a second ambiguous high low mixup that leads to a full combo on H there also exists several resets on hit that Force the opponent to guess or get hit by a second combo with refresh scaling the reward for doing this is more damage but it comes at the risk of the opponent holding Parry or mashing wake up super here are a few examples [Music] [Music] doing doing [Music] [Music] here's a few miscellaneous tricks [Music] [Music] you Mo esap use Fireball faints to avoid Aki's venomous Fang two common answers to akuma's air Fireball are standing heavy kick and a spaced OD Fireball use crouching medium punch to deal with blona ball be extra safe when setting up portals against cam with level three if you have no super meter or drive meter Chun Ley has no way of guaranteeing a drive impact against you if you're Crouch blocking unless you get thrown not practical in the slightest but this setup allows for JP to land an extremely damaging h this only works in DJ while level two is underwhelming in this matchup level three is extremely valuable as it interrupts many of Dam's pressure tools be sure to save up for it OD Amnesia is ill advised against Ed due to his common projectile OPI tools some setups that work against DPS may not work against Honda's OD headbutt OD Fireball is very important when fighting gu use it whenever you need space fire Fireball zoning should be rarely done against Jamie as he has many tools to bypass it if you find yourself spamming Spike against JP you will always win if your opponent isn't burn out certain setups like this allow for JP to trade with jury's DP and beat her level one although this loses to her level three and drive [Music] reversal not specific to JP but if aen uses his medium punch heavy punch Target combo into a special move you can buffer a DI to counter it back medium punch is a great Swiss army knife against many of K's burst approach [Music] options also not specific to JP don't de ey this if he has level three light swipe and a neutral jump and a jumping light kick works against all of M bison's reversal [Music] options this also leads to three very unique situ situations when punishing each of his supers it's worth learning combos to punish all three Manan can spin through Fireballs which makes common pressure sequences risky pressure with caution jumping medium kick is a great air to- air against an aerial Rasheed not super practical but here's a sequence that beats ruse DP level one and mostly beats his level three only losing to level two [Music] JP's overhead Fireball travels over Terry's light Fireball Zone as aggressively as you can against Z and always set up portals thank you for watching my guide I'm going to put a lot of resources in the description of this video to help you find more information about JP this includes some top players Twitter Tech monsters and some general fighting game terminology info information about JP changes every day and there's lots of new tech that's being discovered I plan to post more fighting game content here in the future as well as some music for some games I'm working on so feel free to subscribe if you want to see more of that thank you [Music]
