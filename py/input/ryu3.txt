ryu the poster boy Street Father is a jack of all trades master of none and one of the easiest characters to pick up in Street Father 6 he has great buttons decent frame data and some of the highest damaging combos in the entire game today I want to show you all the tips and tricks that I know on how to take Rio from the lowest rank in the game rookie to the highest rank in the game master so without further ado let's get right into the video it's that time of the year again where we try to take a character from the lowest rank in the game rookie all the way to the highest rank in the game master i'm going to be limiting myself in every single rank so from rookie to gold we have a game plan then from platinum to diamond we have a game plan and from diamond to master we have a game plan where I'm going to limit myself and primarily use the fundamentals of fighting games in order to teach everybody that you can pick up characters pretty easily in this game with a simple game plan and a simple strategy so talking about Ryu a little bit right here ryu is a shoddo character and one of the beginner characters of the game that is recommended next to like Luke Cammy Marissa Lily like characters like that essentially going over what the shooter play style is the show play style basically consists of two things if you're far away from your opponent you would fireball and just primarily make it your goal to fireball the opponent and if you are doing that correctly you would then look into the air and try to anti-air them if they try to jump in our case we're going to use the crouching heavy punch from Ryu for that because DPing is too hard for somebody who's completely new to fighting games it is just not a thing so if we have somebody like basically jumping right here at us we would just do this crouching every punch and then just call it a day essentially we just call it a day we're just like "Yep that's just all we're going to do for now." Then we have medium kick standing medium kick this one is used for poking so if somebody comes in against us we just basically keep them away we're like "No thank you get away from us." Uh we use crouching medium kick as well uh crouching medium kick is a really good button in Street Fighter 6 overall and it's going to be used in order to just fireball right after so what we're going to do is we're going to crouch a medium kick and then just medium fireball against our opponent that's going to be the goal of that and uh besides that we're not really going to be using too many too many other buttons right now this is this is just basically the ones that we're going to run with for now as for combos I'm not going to use any hard combos up until platinum so for now the only thing we're really going to use is going to be two confirms which is crouching light punch crouching light kick and the crouching light punch this primarily is used in order to just stop the opponent from pressing anything and also not being able to walk back if I have Cammy right here hold a button and walk back as you will see she will get hit right here and you would be able to at a later point like actually like continue to combo properly or just basically hit them out of it another thing that this is really good against is drive impact if your opponent wakes up against you and you go for these three buttons to just be able to get through it like this and then you can do basically whatever as a follow-up so this is just a DI save setup so we don't have to deal with the most obnoxious thing at early elos uh we have just the opportunity of if we do land it as a combo we can just tatu afterwards so we can go for something like this 1 2 3 L elatsu we're in front of our opponent we can go for whatever as pressure strike for shimmy so we can like press a button for our opponent or just wait for them to do something and yeah besides that this is going to be the basic game plan all the way to gold we're not going to use any drive rush combos so far because I just don't really think it matters as of right now if we ever have any reaction checks I will try to meet them as best as possible if we see a drive impact we obviously always drive impact back and the basic goal is just going to be to have basically intention behind everything we're doing so it's like okay he walks towards us standing medium kick he jumps at us crouching heavy punch he's far away fireball oh he's he's really close right here and trying to walk back we have this and then if he's super close we have this and that's pretty much all we're going to do and obviously we're going to drive impact to drive impact however if I do land if I do land the punish counter right here I will just do super basic standing heavy punish HTP right here as a combo so without further ado let's actually start with the rookie master journey all right and we found our first ranked opponent which is Chun Lee obviously in rookie our connection is not going to be the greatest cuz there's not that many players down here but from China is crazy 200 fing but yeah we'll stick to the game plan we'll slowly fireball our opponent we have no reason to do anything else for now we just keep doing this like we're not forced to do anything here you just stick to the game plan ah got punish counted there going to try to throw her if she gets close but yeah we we just like as shos we don't we don't want to we don't want to like overdo it oh I drive rush an accident it's my bad all right a good throw right there perry Perry loses to throw very very hard so if this Chan Lee just decides to like go out of her way and do it then please be my guest you know please be my guest we're going to keep fireballing and if you have the opportunity we're going to throw her fireball get close throw her again why not just going to keep doing it yeah very simple game plan we're just we're just basically going to stick to what we know hit our opponent right here oh keep her on her fireball crouch we pick fireball we have no reason to really like do anything else because again she's not presenting us like any any threat whatsoever and as you can see right here we're going to do very simple antires if we see her in the air just a crouching heavy punch if you react to it round two nice fireball i don't know what that was going to do but yeah we're going to continue press our croucher medium kick fireball well we're just going to keep it as simple as we can as I said like going to fireball away going to abuse fireball as much as possible especially from like super far range like this where she can't just easily jump in like it is absolutely crazy just go for that but yeah that's it that's the round like we don't we don't really have to do anything fancy it is it is basically the lowest rank in the game right so keeping it as simple as possible all the way to gold is going to be the goal or even in gold right all the way to platinum basically kajosen oh my lord is that laggy general rule by the way if you see an opponent do anything on your block that looks laggy as hell make sure to always try to press at least a medium punch medium punches are really fast and um they're good they do they deal good damage so just as a general rule because frame it does something that is like foreign to people if they're beginning if anything just looks like it takes a very long time to like recover that's like a pretty good idea but yeah we're going to we're just going to be patient here i have no reason to interact with this Mai like at all i have literally no reason to interact with her she has to do something cuz her health is way lower than mine i guess she just keeps pairing like that we go forward but like you know we could have just stayed there and just done nothing boom see laggy simple punish button special i wanted to do had but I did hit the wrong button guess who also Guess who also has these issues rookie players oh my god i'm just like them see how she's jumping anti-air crystal clear side of anti-air we missed the anti-air there cuz we were a bit off but it's fine who cares also a good thing about her being a burnout right now is we can trip her you can trip her to death one more button and that's it again looks laggy crouch medium kick wins there we go skill is everything so real so real all right our last opponent to rank up to iron is Jamie he's just as shocked as we are 300 ping see this is the this is the low elo experience until you get to like silver this is crazy jesus that is nuts i mean I'm down again looks laggy punish very simple round two i'm very happy once we're out of here once we're in like bronze I can like look for like people that like U connection we're just going to keep doing this fireball button fireball button fireball fireball fireball one more done simple yet effective iron rag round one i mean you know what I mean like if he's so interested in trying to parry all of these he just dies like I don't know what to tell you i don't know what to tell you hey we'll just keep going he's very low health now everything we do here is going to be fine okay he threw us back to the stage that's not bad for us and then he dies because he plays it risky wins oh wellol brazil let's hope he's in Europe and just has a Brazil flag how about it bots nope just kidding well against Zenf as well we just keep fireballing we can try to push our way in eventually and do damage but like as long as we can force a jump out of him just like this we just play the game clean and safe and risk free he wants to get to us what do we do medium kick nice good stuff in the zeni laggy we use button i'm waiting for a drive impact in the corner you should always look for drive impact by the way that should be like the general rule you should always look for drive impact in the corner round two fight why you accepting these connections it is iron who the hell is going to be an iron i can't find anything otherwise so like until we're in bronze this is just what you have to do this is unfortunately all you have to do i've done enough of these at this point that I know like okay this is all you can realistically do until like bronze okay ko i can't believe he won that round by just pressing Adulan that is so funny yeah simply effective okay get away from me get away from me a few iron players play iron i'm shocked no it's not about that but it's it's more about like I'm just surprised we got away with like literally just fireballs in an entire round and it just worked you know going to try to keep our distance from Zingie because the closer he is to us the worse it gets for us there we go no that was a misinput it was a misinput fireball fireball fireball button fireball fireball fireball fireball fireball button fireball button fire a looks laggy button fireball insane wins anyway here's a hadulken okay okay okay kind of kind of ironic no kind of ironic no kind of ironic that the game gives us that as a reward here's a doen i mean that's all I've been doing that round okay but what I was saying was like I want to see how it's like in platinum and diamond because usually it took me around like 10 hours with like 90 98% win rate to just get to that rank so it should be a lot it should be like a lot more stressfree now i don't got to like just bore myself for like 10 hours and do nothing but yeah going to fireball away that is the wrong combo i'm so sorry i just wanted to do red special but I guess not i guess not i guess not no not the real no not the real button get away from me get away from me get the hell away from me wench i don't want your feet i can't wait for the comments to be like I want her feet don't care is that the rank up no it's not okay one more round round one it looks laggy always try to press a button boom boom boom boom we're like an iron wall for this jury it is insane he got no chill want to get in adulen nice and just like that we're bronze yippi kay now we might finally find people that don't lag that'll be nice okay our first opponent in bronze is going to be a Ken we got a shoddo playoff fireball fireball see fireballs as well we're going to keep it simple here have a little fireball war going on with each other oh fireball so the way to beat fireballs here is to simply just jump over them that's like one of the counter plays you can do the other one is to go for a an EX fireball in order to beat the other one but we're not going to use any EX so far in in these ranks it's not going to be a thing we're going to start using like actual combos once we reach like again like D um not diamond sorry platinum but yeah Adulen Adulken Adulken Adoken we're just going to keep using Adulkan don't chill since he's not trying to jump we have no reason to stop right we know the basic counterplay towards it so oh from Hadoken haden had antire haden always look into the air while haden okay and you give up well all right cammy cammi is one of those characters where fireballs don't really work as well because she is an anti- fireball character so against her you would like to use let's say like more more simple approaches in like actually trying to play the game a little bit so you can't just fireball from like Narnia it's it's a bit better to just hit her at like let's say like a mid-range it's like anywhere like here actually press buttons and eventually you can fireball every now and again but you can't just spam it doesn't she doesn't really allow you to spam it but as I said we're keeping it super simple one button and do special inputs most of them are just me [ __ ] up like I said I was only going to use like the crouch minion kick into a doken but sometimes you make mistakes and I just do the wrong button in the wrong special and it's like it's actually not even on per like I'm not even doing it on purpose i'm genuinely just [ __ ] it up cuz my mind's just so locked into that but yeah going to keep it as simple as possible stay close to her okay okay bit aggressive don't you think bit aggressive don't you think man oh this this JP is actually pretty faster that's not bad [Music] oh strong strong strong damn he's actually getting us i guess we have to switch strategies against this guy we got to we got to go in a little bit cuz he's very he's very passive and we already lost a lot of health so now we can't just like sit on our ass and do nothing oops wrong button going to jump in right here ah I can't do that right you got to use medium punch fireball fireball ah see he's really passive so we got to change our strategy a little bit and just be a bit more aggressive against him we can't just like fireball our way into everything we got to get a bit closer and also we're going to try to now focus ourselves on these drive impact he's done a lot of them so our new mission should be if we see it to actually counter it back very simple punish ah it's the pro timing here in the corner always look for drive impact is like a general rule going to have to be a bit more careful ah that punished us got to make sure not to lose the win streak nice not against every opponent or attack sorry a tactic doesn't really work against every opponent every single time so obviously once we once we realize like okay this isn't really going anywhere we have to make sure we adapt oh whoops that was on accident there we go again he drive impacts a bunch going to make sure we actually cover that try to jump in a bit watch out for Drive Impact he jumps so much damn jumped again he just backs off he's not even trying to play much nope nope one more fireball is going to do it ah I can't believe it we actually lost that man crazy since I have to Since I have to just do the bare minimum I can't do anything else right we just got to be patient that's fine we should have looked for more drive impacts that's for sure should have looked for a lot more of them maki one two three now all of a sudden he's so easy he's just getting hit over and over can't believe it i can't believe it [Music] basic ass jumpins yeah we're just going to avoid that throw they're just going to avoid that throw right here drive impact drive impact he does it a lot so going to try to get through that mess up the throw see we're just going to get hit here man got to be careful ant air impact see if we adapt it's not that difficult is it we'll be able to go through just fine we know he loves to jump a lot we know he loves to drive impact a lot and he's pretty passive so it's going for the simple things will get us to win round one nope we see something like that we're just going to jump over it oh that was an accident i meant to do there but that actually is pretty helpful huh guess we learned something new anti-air bro [Music] simple combo i always tried to do [ __ ] Adulkan but I'm just messing up man messed up my buttons i'll play Rio like that but it's fine it's It's good enough it suffices doesn't it are you going to jump no are you going to drive impact got to do something at some point i know you want to ah wait what the hell my controller disconnect my controller disconnected for a second wait are we fine i don't know what just happened all right because of that mistake I have to be very patient now and then I'll jump in there we go dude controller just disconnected for me completely i have no idea why this might be our rank upset against this can i believe 5,000 points is what you need in order to be jump over that oops throw oh my god the lags flags are crazy yeah simple punish express buttons you plan on getting bison the master i'm not against it i'm not against it at least my controller disconnected again what's the issue i I don't understand why it keeps connecting and disconnecting okay oh fair enough you need one more special and he's burned out okay we win that was a bit weird wasn't it that was a tiny bit weird wasn't it aben him okay jump and air oh exp damn and air and the crouchy medium kick you already know the classic the classic that's the goal jump simple button extp and these people actually are exping and like using using inputs consistently that's nice nice to see let's use that here anti-air and that's it are we silver yep very nice you love to see it okay our first match in silver is going to be against a guile that's going to be interesting that's going to be very interesting so again fireballs you beat them by jumping over them and then against Sky we're going to be in the fireball world for a very long time very very long time we need to make sure we actually jump over those fireballs consistently hey these people are already using exps here man what the hell i can't even I can't even use drive rush yet see he's trying to jump over the fireball so if we know that we're going to fireball occasionally get him to jump at us get away get away round two anti-air jump over the fireball basic combo ah don't hesitate to fireball yourself every now and again am I dead i'm not looks laggy punish oops wrong button i want to fireball wins and he quits well this just happens it is what it is it's normal god damn fireball fireball damn okay so we got to be careful this guy loves Drive Impact so we're What are we going to do we're going to chill a bit going to wait for him to actually do it anti-air fireball from afar then we drive impact back heavy punch or Yuken an air fireball we actually win those exchanges against Terry so we can just fireball the way and not give a [ __ ] we can just not care yep that's fine wrong button that was supposed to be a fireball wait sometimes you make mistakes it's fine ant hair fireball ant hair yeah I did mess up throw him damn always looking for drive impact in the corner really important the most common thing that people are going to do and that's it he got greedy in the end he got real greedy in the end is this Lily our rank up match to gold let's see let's see she might just be rankup opportunity okay let's win this match and then we are gold enjoyers against Lily let's just fireball away no fireball if she does jump we anti-air or we jump ourselves who cares little bit of jumping never hurt nobody in this game especially at lower elo i'm going just keep you away i don't care get away from me get away from me get away from me small child get away from me [Music] there we go round two fight there's going to start to drive impact which means you got to be a bit more careful now going to start looking for drive impacts and jumps back for all drive impact always look for drive impact in the corner okay that's fine damn nice jump in we're going to jump in as well now and again and now we're going to go away and I'm going to fireball and I'm going to fireball [Music] oh are we dead no we're fine i drive versus myself an accident that was on purpose i meant to I meant to [ __ ] heavy punch but it's okay we're in gold yippee boys quick strategy meeting what are we going to do now how are we going to change our game plan how do we How do we actually like do something now what can I do more now okay so now I'm going to allow myself to do literally one combo more which is going to be a dry brush combo it is going to be crouching medium kick standing heavy punch into crouch medium punch and then any special I want to do as a follow-up so if I want to do this donkey kick and go for donkey kick if I want to go for tatsu I'm going to go for tatsu and if I want to go for DP I'll go for DP that's going to be it i just want to finally do damage because we're not doing we're not dealing any damage we're not dealing any damage at all and um yeah we're we're just going to do that for now and then once we're in platinum we'll add even more stuff we're still not going to use any of the system mechanics we're still not going to like just drive our sh neutral or like DI the entire time randomly or like for anything else uh the buttons always stay the same we're just going to try to keep it as simple as possible sometimes we might just hit like a heavy punch or something but overall poor game plan stays the same until platinum also by the way if you're interested in coaching like this but personalized make sure to check out the first link in the description oh first opponent is Manon nice nice nice nice manon is so based i'm a fan i'm a fan fireball fireball fireball she in particular struggles against fireballs a lot actually anti-air fireball anti-air fireball looks laggy buttons fireball and combo [Applause] now we're actually allowing ourselves to do a little combo game we love to see it we love to see it basic Street Father has ended and Street Father 6 has started again there's something looks laggy go away and do something against it i can't use any exps or anything yet so I can't even get out properly it's fine am I dead here yep fireball punish oh my god okay fair enough see that was the wrong button ant hair button jump in oops that is not what I meant to do i wanted to do level uh I wanted to do DP on level one we're not I I shouldn't I shouldn't do any supers until like PL okay again if it looks laggy what do we do boys we press a button because why the hell not drive impact beats drive impact boop boop boom boom boom round two fight have impact simple going to dash back going to follow us here hell no get away from me get away from me wench one two three boom and we go for a throw right here okay fair enough that is again not what I want to do i'm messing up man i just want to hit I just want to hit my DP aki a how you doing Aki [Music] enter button i hit level one continue and did I You know what i'll just do donkey kick i don't care like legit I just I give up on the DP i'm giving up i'm messing that up so much okay that's death if she just goes for parry there I mean what can I do realistically what can you do now i mean okay kind of got stuck there in a little combo to jump in against her jump in are actually really effective against these players it's insane he got no antiers yet let's just do this man i I give up oh nice that was actually a good end here hell yeah there we go round two fight him there we go little jump right there in order to prevent them from doing anything like a super or like a fro or whatnot usually players in gold they like to they like to go for reversals a lot and in platinum it's going to be even worse where they just love to reversal no matter what like you see them like here in the corner and just boom anytime they're like in a stress situation or low health they just love to do it it's like their absolute like hobby so you got to be like pretty pretty careful and like try to bait it out sometimes i I do rookie to master the characters I like and and can't play and they're like just good choices to play but like if you told me I had to do a rookie on master like I don't know like Lily or something eh you think oh bison is cool i don't like bison i don't like bison to play at all i'm hella good on that i basically just bought the DLC and was done with it like just to lab against them i like big numbers i do too but I like them on YouTube haden do you know my haden jump for my How are you not dead i'm in there double three no i want one clean jump in here once we're in platinum I'll actually start to like try with punishing and everything it's going to be nice one two three dude do your thing buddy do your thing bomb bomb wins round one i sure get key will they ever drive impact for me diamond pack yay yippee oh my lord i just basically dashed into that that's fun dude that was aw that's just a habit at this point i'm glad I got a habit of just antering though that's nice dude stop please please stop all right our last matchup before Platinum is going to be against Guile our last big hurdle i'm just going to throw him right here something you can do on Drive Rush if you don't want to go for a combo is you can go for like a mixup like you can go for like a throll like anything else always drive impact to drive impact boom boom and then simple button and thy be more careful if we catch him jumping we got to make sure we anti properly okay put for Okay fair enough [Music] ah drive impact to drive impact super important man super important super super important man is he going to catch me with this oh no he's just going to jump straight up fair enough throw him like that okay ah simple combo keep him there oh my god he's just throwing us ah simple punish get him out of here impact [Music] to drive impact see if we just stay patient it's not going to be too hard to win here one two three boom and then one two three going to jump probably okay the eyes is fine too jump uh okay one more for all or just one more button and that's it he just level one and with that we're platinum yippi kay damn boys we made it rematch the guy i'm still going to play the way how I would play in gold obviously because I haven't explained the game plan yet or anything so I will actively go out of my way and still play as simple as humanly possible and then we'll discuss the game plan for Platinum to Diamond oops [Music] you want to use fireballs go ahead you love fireballs so much don't you anti-air [Music] oh [Music] drive impact beats what drive impact holy hell one two three boom and anti-air fireball fireball fireball and that's it that is it let's start discussing the platinum to diamond game plan so platinum diamond game plan i'm now allowing myself to do a couple more things as in I'm now allowing myself to use supers supers is something I haven't used at all yet or anything like an exp i I am so tired of people mashing on me and I can't even ext so just being able to actually do like EX buttons now like ex fireball ext i'm also going to try to whiff punish a lot more and actually try to play the game so now that we are round about platinum you should be good enough to actually start playing neutral so I'm going to try to actively whiff punish when I see a button whiff with like anything like a standing heavy punch interesting heavy punch is really strong or even something like sweep sweep is a really good button to use overall on Rio so it's something that needs to be abused uh the combo game is going to be pretty much about the same the only thing I'm going to change for the fireball stuff is I'm also going to allow myself to actually input a DP now now that I can do ext on supers I don't see a where I couldn't also just DP after seeing a fireball so we're going to try to anti-air like this exclusively with fireballs like here I'm still going to do this until like diamond but yeah that's going to be the gameplay adjustments we're actually able to use like a couple more things now so I can do like a full combo here like this one two three and then actually go for like a level three afterwards okay our first opponent with a new strategy is Terry modern Terry even mod Terry even and we're still going to keep like the the basic basic game plan of just like doing like basically like whatever here we're still not going to use the system mechanics properly until we reach like diamond we're still going to keep it pretty much like as basic as humanly possible entire button one one two three round two he's going to get hit for that nice should have drive impact to that drive impact but what can you do oh yeah I can exp now i forgot let's do it let's get out drive impact drive impact [Music] i did a dry rush on accident that is my bad [Music] okay i still cannot do level three here level three doesn't work yet okay that caught me unfortunate damn he called us for that but he messed up all right we're going to level three here in order to burn him out are you doing supers and plat we are using supers just not system mechanics and throw wins nice that's a good approach okay ah [Music] I made a mistake oops let me jump in here nice throw him right here button button button easy round round two easy round ah that jumping cocked us we're going to get full punish here got to make sure not to always just fireball got to keep it clean level three here very very simple level three [Music] and now we're going to go for burnout we're going to go a bit further away okay so you're going to try to drive impact always look for drive impact in the corner no okay that's fine by me too uh we're going to jump right here in order to avoid the super you see as I said at in in like platinum and gold people love to use reversals so it's always smart advice to try to be like more passive not proactive be a lot more passive like actually like wait in the corner for them to do something either try to anti-air at them with like a button or just wait for him to do like the super and then full punish them and the full punish doesn't have to like be hard you can just do the basic stuff that we're doing right now which is just standing heavy punch or you can level three that's already good enough you don't need to do any super fancy crazy combos i think combo game in this game is so simple you don't have to make it very difficult for yourself you can just Okay you can just have it very very easy a lot of the time see how he's trying to jump out the entire time oh my god I messed up one two level one done round two fight okay again if something looks laggy use a medium button you You may or may not actually get a full combo for nothing now we're going to jump okay we're going to throw one more time and now we're going to be patient okay smart good stuff good stuff good stuff from the from the Akuma i didn't expect that whatsoever it's actually really good i did not expect that i thought he was just going to reversal immediately honestly being truthfully honest I thought he was just going to reversal right away okay the next terrier we're fighting going to try to keep this educational as possible going to throw a couple fireballs every now and again but nothing too fancy again always look for drive impact here guys always look for drive impact here it's very important very very important anti-air button just to keep him away fireball a bit fireball a bit from far away and then we obviously should look into the air every now and again so like we're doing it you know okay shyuken this is our first Shyuken this is our first Shyuken after a fireball i'm so happy I can finally use it i'm still waiting for your ter master guide i'm sorry i've been a lazy [ __ ] and just never edited it it's It's completely done i just need to edit and post on YouTube but if I'm already doing the real one you know I might do the Terry one like right after i'm just a lazy [ __ ] when it comes to that but I can't be as lazy anymore ah simple fireball he's going to jump eventually anti-air i'm just going to jump in here double free question is is he dead ryu does so much damage holy yeah he is dead he is giga dead it's not even close oh now we're getting a,000 points plus wow wow wow wow that is insane that is a lot of points [Music] have impact have impact boom boom is it normal in plot trying to do DP for anti-air for a fireball yes in general no which is why I'm only doing it after fireballs so you see here I'm only doing one buttons i'm only doing one buttons for like regular jumpins but like for fireball yes absolutely cuz you're looking into the air all the time like here it is completely normal to do it it's just like if Guile if if Guy does like his um his anti-air after fireball that is completely normal yes if you're any if you're a non- fireball character then absolutely this is nothing normal but for Cammy I didn't include even antire to like basically master almost single button going to keep it clean with the fireballs get close to you and that's that Elena oh wow how sweet how sweet how sweet hello Ellena No sexy snark god damn i know what he means maybe this is our rank up game to diamond cuz we're getting like a a thousand plus points it should be it should be it should be [Music] laggy button we punish that fireballs fireballs slow fireballs try to throw slow fireballs cuz she's super far away and then if she jumps we try to anti-air click the little button right here round two fight what a di what a di damn going to go for throw mix up right there instead of going for the button cuz she's obviously blocking anti-air fireball ant hair fireball anti-air wait for it this time she might go for di again you never know right level one [Music] and that's the round just knowing the basics is so important as you can see just knowing the barebone basics i'm not doing any like super hard execution thing i'm not making it like extremely difficult for any like for anybody to do the same strategy just fireballs she might jump look for it no okay we keep going she's close we try to press buttons one two three one two three we're going to keep going until it stops working enter button and as you can see these people love to mash when they're low health they always want an escape option no matter what they always want an escape option okay ah I messed up my punish shot eventually she's going to jump see ah this is exactly when we fireball how unfortunate you know this just just happens this just happens sometimes you're wrong sometimes you're wrong on when your opponent's going to do something the idea was correct but like Mhm i'm just going to walk forward bro here i don't care diamond hell yeah i'm so glad it doesn't take that long anymore to actually rank up in these ranks okay let's discuss the final game plan to master now so the final game plan to master is now going to be I can allow myself to use the systems of the game that means I can drive rush in neutral i can DI i can drive reversal i can use parry now consistently like just the entire time if I would like to uh that as for our neutral game plan I'm going to start using specials a lot more donkey kick is actually really really good for Ryu as one of his like primary options and it's just farreaching move very very safe so we're going to start losing that another thing is going to be overhead pressure so right here on like these you saw how like sometimes I did like this on like I I did this this is an actual strategy that you can do in like higher elo you're very plus here so if you go for like a strike throw mixup you can actually like threaten your opponent with like several options here such as like strike throw and shimmy however another thing you can do is just stop it all together and go for something like a throw or an overhead the override I haven't used whatsoever same as like the forward heavy punch so like the good buttons of Rio we're going to actually start using now forward heavy punch is really strong this is really strong donkey kicks really good uh jumpins are good but you got to like use them wisely and I'm actually allowing myself to just finally just anti-air altogether so I would just be anti-air right now as much as I possibly can and yeah we're going to we're going to start playing as normal as we possibly can with the character and not breaking out of diamond without dive kick little bro okay we'll see about that she feel him nice quick little pressure right there on burnout damn he's so diavy [Music] you know what because you love the ice so much I'll do you a favor die by your own tactic oh you're not dead yet okay one sec let me just back real quick there we go that's a lot better wins that's a lot better round one fight my bad you [ __ ] uses so much drive that uses so many drive impacts damn I was supposed to be level one and again even in diamond these people love to mash out at low health so just take that in mind keep that in mind sorry not take that in mind i need to look for these drive impacts more i swear he like that like look at him just doing those mhm [Music] i messed up nice fireball got the win same game plan again couple fireballs keep the game clean what the hell wow that was some lag jesus that was more than just a little bit of lag let's roam for that see even at top or sorry the top see even at like higher levels we're still using something as simple as like just touching medium kicken just because it's a safe option to do it's a very safe option to go for these people love drive impact i swear these people love Drive Impact this is like their [ __ ] no that's my bad i should have called out that DP that DP was such a free call out nope can't do that let's burn him out and air wait for it there we go there we go oh there we go okay back throw him into the corner jump at him okay he doesn't have any bar left so he's going to try to jump cuz he does not want to get burned out we're just going to wait it out until we see an opportunity there we go that's the opportunity we're looking for bomb bomb bomb and that's the round clean round one fight okay he's not the only one that can use this you know we also can occasionally use a drive impact if we think he's not looking for it round two mhm can't do that man [Music] [Music] damn should we just full send oh should we boom i think he's dead [Music] ah not quite not quite not quite hey we got him got him a very clean EX fireball hell yeah and we're going to be fine this is our last opponent and it's my main we got to fight against Cammy ah come on ridiculous ridiculous ridiculous why why against my main why against my man oh well we're going to we're going to make as education as possible keep it clean yep he's going to spin up quicker as an anti- fireball character it's just how this how this stuff works going to bait this out yep going to do a little baiting there we go little baiting because if you throw them a couple times guess what they're going to do they're going to try to just get through aduling through this like why it's chill a bit huh bs okay driver again you can always expose this it's completely fake on Cammy you can't do that you know it's coming it's very easy to expose we need one more good opening and we're done that's it that's the round and then we need one more match just one more wins we're on the verge we're 70 points away even if we lose now it's not going to be too hard to like get the points if we lose like the set now but I think losing to Cami is not going to be that hard for me or like that easy because I know this character in and out i know exactly what she wants to do at what range and when whiff punish [Music] little whiff punisher but what can he do can't do that now you want to jump eventually don't you you want to get out here can't do that either man overhead boom [Music] drive Impact see we're going to be drive impact abusers now if you only keep using against me I'll use against you guys too have you done anything with dungeon no i don't I don't think dungeon is necessary to get to like master so I'm just not even I'm not even considering using it like I'm using the most basic combos in the world and just playing clean neutral and footsies and antairring like I'm just playing Fundies quite literally you're so quick cammy is so fast man this is somebody who's play like playing against us is is actually insane like dude she is so fast got to be so careful ah unfortunate well little fancy combo here that I'm showing for once i mean it's the end of it's the end of the road so I can do I can do a little bit more more cool [ __ ] and that's it that's it that's Ryu Rookie to Master Fast Edition the speedrun edition honestly at this point this only took like 2
