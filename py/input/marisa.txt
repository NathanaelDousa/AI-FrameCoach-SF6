what's up guys this is Big Bird and today we're going to be talking about Marissa and a simple basic guide for beginners so basically I'm going to be explaining a lot of uh her moveset about how they are used how is she supposed to play and basically an overall uh game plan for her before we start make sure you hit that like comment and subscribe and turn the notifications on and let's get started so Marissa is a big body character as you can see uh she's a character that hits hard but she moves slow she has slow buttons and you know she's typically a big body character big body characters are really ever fast but she does make up for it when it comes to her damage now let's get started so her normals consists of Stan job stamina punch stand heavy punch sound like it stamina kick signific now for the caution we got job medium Crouch heavy couch like crash media punch crash heavy kick three she also has a bunch of command normals she has overhead which is her down four heavy punch she has a four minute Bunch which can be canceled into which can be canceled into either kick Ender or heavy Point punch it and so you got four media punch for me to flush into heavy punch or you got four mini punch into heavy kick now what's the difference between the two the four minute punch heavy punch knocks down but the four meter punch heavy kick gets canceled to Super which is amazing if you ask me you can also be canceled until her level two or even level three and the best part about the solid combo is it's confirmable however it's not all good because it kind of loses to uh kind of doesn't hit crouching so as you can see if I set him to crouch it whips and leaves you at -21 which is enough time to do basically anything so be careful and use it if you hit them crouching go for the heavy punch Ender if you had them standing go for the uh the the heavy kick Ender of course then she has also a bunch of Target combos she has the jab jab this doesn't connect the job is not cancelable but it can be canceled into another job which is cancelable now it's the job into job is not a true block string it's okay you can Parry kind of reversal whatever but when you do jab jab into light Gladius it's a true block string and it's guaranteed chip damage now for the Miss how many punch shells are this which is one of the best which was one of our best uh buttons it's seven frames four active frames and it's cancelable into anything now when people try to press against her usually they're met with Gladius and now also she has heavy punch Ender which is in my opinion it's not very useful uh because there's a gap in between the heavy punch and the Second Heavy punch and it's Plus on block but the distance is way too much she also has a 40K heavy kick which in my opinion also useless because I don't see any use of it I haven't even used it and I've been playing Marissa for like what uh almost close to two months now now let's get started with the special moves she has Gladius the light the medium and the heavy one now the light one the light one is 70 frames the medium one is 19 frames and the heavy one is 22 frames so the higher you go the slower it is but it covers more distance the higher you go the more this is you cover and the more damage you get you also have the sparta kick which is good to close range like to get to close the distance the heavy one kinda almost goes full screen the media one is the in the middle and the light one is the the shortest the fastest but it's the most punishable one it's one is six now with the Gladius I forgot to mention this but the Gladius can be charged and you can use it to mess up your opponents with punish so deals if you use Gladius you find yourself with punish then you cannot punish you go if you find yourself beginning with punished by the light one go for the heavy one to mess up the timing because you need to try to punish the light one and they do it fast so the heavy one is slow and it kind of Beats their move punish attempt now the the third part of our subashim moves is her Superman punch someone punch is a great professional move that can't close the distance between the characters for example like for example for fear here you can use it to close distance it's plus two on block non-punishable and you can't easily drive impact it the medium goes furthest and the heavy one goes the furthest but you know the higher you go the more recovery it has and the more the slower it becomes so pretty much that's how our special moves go the light one I mean the Superman punch goes over Fireballs has armor from frame six to frame 15 I think or something like that and it's basically questions lows it has armor and it can go over Fireball so it's a good tool if you're getting zoned out now her last special move is the stance stance you can't cancel normal formats for example if I try to Castle Almost from it I can't but the stands have three follow-ups it has Target as overhead to the dark combo that's the sweep and it has the command Pro which is very strong in the Commando look at the damage now me and my personal I don't use overhead a lot and I don't I definitely don't use the cake because the cake if you block it it's minus 24 which is you know a no-go for me personally but it's a good way like for example if you if you cancel it's a good way to to get a reset uh it's a good way to pressure your opponent on block if they keep blocking it's a good way to do it and also an example so it's a good way to use that normal you can also use it after after blocking uh if they don't want to move and if they if you start using Commandos more often then that's when they start panicking and start jumping and getting your free damage now for aunties she has two different she has four differentiers the first one is the car Chevy punch it's tenth nine frame but it's pretty slow and sometimes it gets stuffed she also has the Gladius was set up to jump Gladius is amazing as an anterior uh crunchy but it's also good if you're late if you're early and I guess certain jumpings I guess heavy is usually loses but it's still pretty good to use if you're early and then she asked the ex launcher you can also use the light launcher if you want this which is also has upper body visibility to get a knockdown and then you also have the airtight combo which is my favorite this one is your best so for example Marissa has a dead zone which she can't enter across it reliably see an entire course of the library so your best bet is to use the jump Target combo that's in my opinion bus antire it knocks down you can get okay if you drive Rush and you can basically get started just from entering that way so that'll be it as a basic guide for Marissa I hope you guys enjoyed it there will be part two coming later that will make us go a bit more advanced just make sure you like comment and subscribe turn the notifications on and we'll see you at the next video
