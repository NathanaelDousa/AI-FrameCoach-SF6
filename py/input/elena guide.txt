elena is a tricky yet rewarding character once you get into her groove her Linux song special allows you to keep your opponent on their toes with his various follow-ups while also bypassing projectiles her wide variety of anti-airs once used properly can force your opponent to play the ground game where Elena can harass with her hit confirmable buttons add on her ability to heal herself with her level two super art along with her high damaging combos that are drive efficient elena can be a menace in the right hands what's good YouTube it's your boy Cusco on the ones and twos doing it big never small and on the second day after Elena's release I reached grandmaster rank with her picking up a new character can be daunting so I crafted this guide in hopes of accelerating your progress i am a competitive Street Fighter 6 player since launch and I have been competing within fighting games across various titles for over 15 years we'll be discussing how to utilize her normals be threatening in the neutral as well as how to land her damaging combos grab your notepad plug in your controller of choice because you're about to learn how to play Elena at a high level starting off we're going to be looking at Elena's normals beginning with her stand jab her stand jab is a very awkward button it's not a button that you're going to use quite often if I'm being honest here it is five frames so it's not a four-frame one so it's a little bit slower you can't chain it into another jab it's just a straight hit that comes out like that and then the range isn't the greatest it's like slightly better than her crouch jab but even then I feel like it's not as much of a big deal to which you'll use that more than her crouch jab so the stand jab is plus4 on hit and then on block it is minus two but if we look at her crouch jab which is something you're going to be using quite often it comes out at four frames it has good range almost the same as the stand jab range but like a little bit shorter but still really good distance on it it's plus five on a hit on block it is minus one as opposed to the stand jabs minus two with Elena's stand jab she can combo with her crouch jab that will connect her crouch jab three chains and since it's plus five on a hit you can go into her stand light kick like that and it will still combo speaking of her stand light kick her stand light kick is super good in my quite honest opinion it kind of reminds me of Ken in a sense it's like a stop sign as well as pre- patch cammy it can definitely uh slow down an opponent that's playing pretty aggressive because they have to deal with that attack and if you do some drills you can get comfortable with essentially buffering stand kick into a special like your DP and you're able to react and essentially get a confirm so I'll show that as an example of how like stand kick can be a really good button like that so the stand kick is good to stop your opponent in their tracks and not only that if you're buffering a motion like a DP and as we saw earlier my standing heavy kick got interrupted and you can kind of tell by the frames you can go straight into a DP which makes her stand light kick game really really good but we'll talk more about special moves a little bit later on in the video stand medium punch is an interesting button it comes out at eight frames is plus three on hit and on block it is minus three but this button is actually dynamic in the sense that if you're close it's plus three on hit but if you're further away it's actually plus five and this applies to block as well and it's minus one now stand medium punch isn't special cancellable but there is a target combo out of it if you do an additional stand medium punch which it looks like that and it does combo and you're able to special cancel it this time around i will say uh you are able to delay it but at the same time if you delay it too long then it actually won't combo so like that it didn't combo and then not only that if you actually land this attack on block then it is very punishable at minus 10 and if the opponent is crouching it will actually whiff as well all stam and punch can be used but at the same time do take into consideration that you can't throw this bina willy-nilly because you are very punchable if they are ducking or if they just block it elena's crouch medium punch is pretty good it comes out at eight frames it is hit confirmable and it does special cancel as well so you're able to get a sequence like that going but yeah it's good as a whiff punishment tool it's good um to go into drive rush afterwards when you're playing Atlanta you are going to be use this button quite often just to keep people in check and then try to do like hit confirms out of as well it definitely is a good button offensively and defensively it's plus one on hit but on block if you're very close it is minus four so you are able to be punished for it i mean it's minus four wherever you're at but do keep in mind that if you are too close you will get punished but if you play at this distance you actually can't get punished for it the aminium kick is really good that Elena has it doesn't have amazing range but it does come out at six frames if you're point blank it is actually plus one on block and then on hit it is plus five so it does go straight to stand light kick so this is going to be a bun you're going to use to apply pressure and to keep pressure going they first you have them in a corner you know they just have to hold that on wake up and then you're plus so you can go into crouch jab and it will be your turn and uh this is really good out of dry rush as well as it is plus five so this is definitely going to be a move you're going to be using a lot when you're very up close to the opponent it's special cancelable too so you can even drive rush out of it you can do special moves out of it it's a really good button elena does have a target combo out of stand medium kick being a stand medium kick it's a heavy kick um this is punch ball and block so it's not going to be plus like say for in if you're doing it alone like the just the stand medium kick it's minus eight so you can definitely get punished for it but it is good because you can uh special cancel it and you are able to do some sneaky Linux stuff that we'll discuss a little bit further into this video elena's crouchy medium kick is pretty controversial in the sense that it is a mediocre button it comes out at nine frames which is pretty slow compared to characters like Mai Ken Chi where they have seven frame crouch medium kicks and then Cammy Ryu etc have an eight frame crouch medium kick so it's nine frames and not only that you can't special cancel it so you can't even drive rush cancel out of it like how you know the Street Fighter 6 thing low forward drive rush the classic she can't do it and it's nine frames it's plus4 on hit so you're able to go straight into a crouch jab like that but at the same time if I set up to block it is minus4 on block and as you saw right there she punished me for being too close it's minus4 so you have to space it out so her crouch medium kick is usable but you can't autopilot it so you definitely have to space it out people are going to be more prone to walking back against Elena just because she doesn't have any threatening lows but you can definitely chip away with her crouch medium kick so yeah you just have to slowly chip away and which is her crouch medium kick kind of reminds me of like a like a Mortal Kombat down can't really uh special cancel to anything and this is more so used to get frame advantage and do some uh little bit of damage over time elena does have a target combo out of her crouch medium kick so that's how you're supposed to get her to special cancel it cuz you can't do it naturally but the problem with that is that it does unfortunately whiff on crouching opponents because of course it does so if you hit them like that it will whiff so you would just be completely exposed even if it's a punish counter state it will still whiff so that's very unfortunate so you don't want to go for it that often because sure they might be walking backwards like I'll set my to walk backwards like and get clipped but at the same time like what if they walk back and then they crouch block and then you just let the whole string whiff is definitely a uh do it out of your own caution i don't recommend doing it like as a whip punch is because how wildly inconsistent it is it might be used for like some type of combos but yeah it's it's very unfortunate so we just got done talking about her mediocre crouch media kick and how to use it to your advantage she also has a overhead which is really good if you have an overhead Street Fighter 6 it is a godsend it's really good for closing out matches not just that she does have a follow-up unlike majority of characters if he does it again she can double the damage for 1,200 it is punishable on block but that's something if you're feeling a little bit confident that they're not going to block it you can definitely get more damage out of it and then just by single hit it is actually uh safe on block like if there's no overhead so it's minus two if you finish the string it is minus 14 so it is death on block what's good about overheads in Street Fighter 6 is that you can drive rush and then you do the overhead and you're plus enough to get a combo and not only that it is plus on block as well if they block it so it's plus two overhead is something you're going to be using uh quite often as Elena just because it's really good like I said closing out matches and then you can also start some pressure by being plus or just them not blocking their dome elena has pretty good heavy buttons looking at her standing fierce it has decent range it comes out at 12 frames it's minus two on block and plus two on hit what's good about this is that if they're blocking it does quite a chunk of drive gauge consumption on the opponent so landing two of those on block took away one full bar of drive gauge meter it's really good to chip away your opponent with this attack right here in the neutral not only that it does have a follow-up with a target combo and this is actually hit confirmable so if you see that it lands you can go straight into the target combo the one downside I would say about this move is that it's not special cancelable so you can't go into any of your specials you can't go into a super you can't drive impact uh the only thing you can do is do the target combo but you can do some follow-ups like that speaking of confirmable buns she actually has a unique attack being forward fierce forward heavy punch in which she goes really really far that range is actually really ridiculous actually it does have a pretty slow startup at 16 frames but as you guys can see it goes basically like the entire screen this button is actually hit confirmable as well so she does have a target combo after that in which you just mash the heavy punch button to get the full animation so this button is good at a distance like that but do keep in mind that since it is slow you can get counterattacked pretty fast by like say like a crouch medium kick or like a stand medium punch by my or her stand fierce so if you're doing this attack definitely get into the rhythm no pon tennics for playing Lena because it can be definitely interruptible due to a slow startup i do want to discuss the frames of it so just landing the one on block is minus 4 so that's impossible to punish if you're this far away even right here is probably still not going to be punished yeah even on point blank I did that to her and she wasn't able to punish with her for four frame but if you do the full target combo you will definitely get punished for that so it's - 16 if you let the full string rip and then it is minus 11 if you do the two hits her crouching heavy punch is a move that you're going to be using a lot in combos it comes out at nine frames it's actually a pretty good anti-air as well so if they try to jump you can definitely get stuffed out of it so you have to do it pretty early but it does work as an anti-air if you're not like too comfortable with DPS which I mean that's something I would highly recommend learning because all DP is really good but that is an anti-air just in case if you don't have your DPS ready yet but what's also good about this button is that it is special cancelable unlike her stand fierce where that's not special cancelable she can special cancel the crouch fierce and it actually forces a stand so if I have the opponent crouching it'll force stand so a move like this whiffs on crouching opponents but the crouch furious forces to stand allowing me to land a combo like that her standing roundhouse also known as her standing heavy kick is my favorite button that Elena has in which it has pretty good range as she kind of leaps forward and does this big foot swing it is plus two on a hit comes out at 12 frames and then on block it is punchable it's minus four so you can't do this point blank otherwise you'll get punished but if you do it at a further distance you are actually completely safe so if I do right here I can't get punished but I'll do it point blank you will get punished for it so definitely uh it's kind of like using a crouch medium kick you can't do it too close otherwise you'll get punished so definitely do this at a comfortable distancing between your opponent now this button reminds me of Cammy stand heavy kick and I mean I've mentioned Cammy a handful of times in this video just because I main Cammy so I kind of compare some characters to her a lot but I do like the stand roundhouse just because it does really good drive gauge chip on the opponent it's relatively safe as long as you don't do it super super close to the opponent yeah it has really good distance on it too just look at the range it's really good if say for instance it lands as a counter like say for instance a punish counter I'll use like an actual like example here so there we go it does cause a uh float state and you're able to combo you can even do like a sweep right yeah you can sweep as well if you don't want to spin the bar elena has pretty good range on her sweep so this is kind of one of your go-tos when it comes to whip punishing using a sweep as a whip punish is very reliable and goes really far and then you're allowed to start your pressure she does have a slide which is really good to keep people on their toes it is definitely punishable on block if you do it really close but if you space it out it is actually safe on block so if I'm really close to M like that I am minus 9 so I definitely going to get super punished for that but if I'm like right that's minus 5 ooh yeah that's minus two right there try to punish me now she has an evasive back heavy kick it's one of her unique attacks it actually goes over lows it's pretty neat oo that was kind of sick so that move is really good in evading lows what's really good too is that you can use this when say for instance come in a corner and you think they're going to wake up and grab like and awake kind of like shimmy them knock her down like that you know tech i get grabbed boom got her you can do some Oh I think it's DP it's DP it's DP not heavy but medium light work yeah that's definely a good like way to say first you want to close out a match if you think they're going to go for a grab you can do that so evasive maneuver and then DP and then like I said it's really good at crushing low attacks it's plus three on hit and then it's minus three and you're like out of harm's way so pretty good button does have the typical jumpins jumping heavy kick which can be a little bit tricky because sometimes it hits two hits and can kind of d your combo timing i can't get it to come out consistently yeah like right there and so using a jump in heavy kick can be annoying because of how like not consistent it is because sometimes you'll get the two hits to come out so you can go for stand furious as you know it's just going to hit one time it is less plus on hit so you know you sacrifice some frames there but you can go into like crouch fierce there you can't go into stand fierce because uh stand fierce is 12 frames you're only plus 10 after the jumping she does have crossoff with jump medium kick and jump light punch the jump light punch actually does have a target combo so you can do something like that for more damage and then she does have another target combo that's really good for an anti-air think of it as like hell attack so she can do jump medium punch and just jump fierce and it's what's really good about this you can do like follow ups like that one of the many things that is good as far as anti-air goes for Atlanta she has a handful of anti-air options so that's something to definitely have in your arsenal when looking for people jumping in elena's throws aren't the greatest see I'm going to do a regular throw right here and I'm we're basically full screen if I do a back throw same thing we're pretty far away from each other so if I have them in the corner I'm very far i can't walk up and grab them i can't do a traditional throw loop you know Street Fighter 6 special as I'm way too far away so instead what she has to do she has to drive rush to get her throw loop like that it can be a little bit tricky as well timing definitely does come into play as well as drive gauge consumption there we go what's good about the throw is that you can spin the dry rush also to do and to stand medium kick and that's 11 frames with the dry brush and the counter hit on top of it so you can go into like crouch fierce and stuff like that so looking at Lena's special moves she has a pretty good variety of them we have Rhino Horn which is a move that goes horizontally across the screen quite far is mainly used as like say combo enders and it does have pretty good corner carry so it can go some like keep in mind that it does whiff on crouchers i feel like Elena has a lot of like keep in mind stuff like whiffing on crouchers and etc but yeah it will whiff on crouchers light medium heavy and that's EX as well it'll all whiff so safe for if you want to end it in a combo you can have it either airborne or you can do safer as what we saw earlier with the crouch heavy punch crash heavy punch with force to stand so you're able to go into the rhino horn the X version you're able to follow up say for instance have her corner you can do something like that has a DP being scratch wheel which I feel like really compliments her kit forcing people to play the ground game so yeah this is the light medium and then heavy the heavy version can combo off of like say light starter so I can do something like this you can do that if you would like really good anti-air and it does serve as a invisible wake up too like reversal so if someone tries to do like dry rush pressure you can um call it out by doing ext so it's very um fortunate for Atlanta to have a reversal ext so she does a little twirl depending on what version you do she goes further so that's heavy that was light this is medium and you're able to actually go through projectiles with this maneuver that so you can't necessarily react to it at times sometimes you got to do it preemptively depending on how far you are yeah if you're further away you can see it coming as like my projectiles so it goes pretty slow but a lot of times you are going to do it preemptively and it does have follow-ups after that so that's going to be the light kick so these follow-ups you do forward plus a button so that's one follow-up in which it is minus five I believe on block but once faced properly it's actually safe because you know they're just not in range to punish you so yeah it's minus five but something like that is minus five and we're push back this far there's no way that you're going to get punished for that the medium followup is actually like a combo starter so it's minus 9 on block so you can definitely get punished for it but on hit it does launch them up in the air so you can do like a DP afterwards and then the last one being forward heavy kick is a overhead which is plus two on hit and then on block actually it's minus three so you're safe there's actually another followup besides the light kick medium kick and heavy kick in which if you do forward punch you get to spin again and you can actually loop this infinitely just hold forward and it punches you can keep looping and you can keep twirling on Mai you might be wondering what the additional spin does it actually buffs up her attacks out of Linux song so as you saw earlier that was that but if you do an extra spin to it it actually becomes plus one and becomes a two-hitting attack that one becomes minus four that was the medium after the double twirl and then as we saw earlier as that being an overhead minus three it actually becomes plus when you add in the second twirl being plus three here's what it look like on hit with some of these attacks so something like that it does land if you're uh say you press near the corner you can't get a DP afterwards as an example um and that's just like the popup like we saw on the uh non-charge version and then you can actually combo after the mallet smash like that pretty uh sneaky stuff Elena got with this Linux song stuff the EX version of Linux song grants you access to the charged up versions of the follow-ups like immediately so as opposed doing the double twirl to get the mallet smash to come out you can just do EX make the mallet smash to come out immediately not just that you enter invol frames quicker as you see that on the 10th/1th frame you enter like the invincibility state in which you're able to go through projectiles with the EX version you are able to enter it even quicker so like that i'm trying to react and go do the fan with the EX version I was able to go and I can react to it and do the EX version that's kind of crazy actually that's like what Cammy had and they took it out from Cammy and gave it to Elena anyways up next we do have her spinning scythe in which this is going to be an attack that you're going to be using a lot in combos it is punishable on the block but you can do it out of lights that was the light version this the medium version and this is the heavy version on block it can be interrupted right before the third hit comes out so it is interruptible the last hit just doesn't even attack them if they're crouching but regardless if they're standing or ducking they can definitely punish that um but yeah they'll just be a punishing after the second hit what's neat about the heavy version is that you are able to do a follow-up attack like this and that had no problem hitting as opposed to hitting grounded so since it was airborne I don't have to worry about the opponent having a hurt box that's too small that would get it to width otherwise linux song actually makes this return as after the second hit of the scythe attack you can actually twirl out of it to do some crazy mixups like that so I'm able to block in time we'll do some follow-ups as an example so that was the forward light kick because she was mashing she actually end up getting hit for that but if you try to go for the overhead the crouch jab will get beat you can definitely catch opponents offguard with that twirl say for instance you want to go for the damage or if you want to go for the mixups the X version of the sized attack comes out a bit faster than the heavy version so that's 24 frames and that's 18 frames and uh what this means is that say for if you're doing a crouch medium punch you wouldn't be able to get this to combo because the heavy version is too slow on the startup but instead if you go for EX it would actually combo into it and which you're able to do the follow-ups like you do out of the heavy version elena's last special move is her moon glider in which she does like a little back sway into uh like a leg drop so this is the light it's minus three on block medium is minus two and then heavy is minus two you guys see the heavy one has longer start up but she goes back even further and then on hit plus one plus two plus two light medium heavy what's really uh sneaky about this attack you can actually use this offensively and defensively in the case of an opponent trying to take their turn back i wouldn't recommend doing this constantly you don't want to flowchart it because it becomes predictable but you can catch people offguard so say for instance I'll have Mai do a crouching light punch as a block reversal it's going to be on two hits so I'm going to hit her two times and she should be able to answer yeah she should be able to answer yeah with a crouch jab so if I do crouch light punch crouch light punch at like a reasonable range and do the moon glider attack I can back away and punish her for trying to take her turn back like that and if you're able to land this and can hit confirm you can go straight into a super like a level three yeah and that's all because they try to take their turn back quite sneaky quite sneaky now Mai does have a follow-up after this attack as well in case you want to full send it so just doing that move alone is relatively safe uh as you can't really get punished directly but you can do a follow-up like that with forward punch and you're able to do a little dance that does more damage but do note that if they do block it it is minus in the double digits yeah it's minus 13 so that's what it looks like on the regular version and if you you uh enhance that attack she does a last like upkick follow-up on to Elena's super arts in which she has three like most characters in the game i stated earlier in this video that she has really good anti-airs she also has a level one that's works as an anti-air and it was intended to be an anti-air and it's actually uh invincible to jumping attacks so as you can see right there it didn't do too much damage but as you saw she did float for a little bit so she can do a follow-up so she can do a DP afterwards not just that if you have more than one bar of meter you can actually do this two times in a row and you can DP afterwards so even though I did hype up her level one being the fact that you're able to use as a really good anti-air and able to do follow-ups afterwards it is actually a poor reversal as it does not have any uh invincibility frames on it so what this means is that say for instance as an example if you're burnt out as that happens a lot in Street Fighter 6 you're going to get burnt out eventually and your opponent has you in the corner and they go for their driving impact setup you can't reversal level one confidently because you can get beat by the driving pack yeah like majority of other characters I don't even know what other character loses like that like it's not consistent so if you're a little bit slow you're just going to get hit so that's very unfortunate and uh you can grab her out of it yeah I just grab her out of it you hit her out of it so it's it's a very bad defensive option outside of anti-airing that's going to be something that's going to be a little bit tricky with Elena is that you are going to be possibly in trouble if you just only have one bar meter and you are burnt out elena's level two is pretty versatile I would say um for starters if you hold down on the D-pad or joystick you can use her notorious healing mechanic which I will say is nowhere near as potent as it was in Ultra Street Fighter 4 but it still gives you some life back which is good if you want to go that route and if you just want for raw damage you don't have to hold down on the D-pad on joystick and get the full damage what's good about the super is it has pretty good range as well so she just jumps really far to the opponent and just starts mauling them and unlike her level one it is uh invincible so say for inance if you try to do like as a wake up attack if I try to grab her I'm just going to get hit that's definely going to be a good option if you're like burnt out and you need to like go into like a level two to get out of harm's way last but not least we have Elena's level three in which she gets her soccer skills going on her critical art and honestly her regular level three as well what's good about Elena's level three but what's actually is really good about her level three is that earlier we were talking about it could be a little bit hard to defend the safer in a corner against drive impact when burnt out her level three is corugle back motion so what that means is that if you're crouch blocking and you're anticipating a drive impact to splat you you're more prone to get your super out as opposed to other characters as an example Cammy where her level three is core circle forwards because you can buffer the level three going backwards while still defending at the same time so the chances of you getting hit is less than you doing like a course of a forward motion so that can come in handy just in case uh you know your backus gets to the corner and you can just buff her to level three if you see your driving impact come out pretty good defensive super all right now we're going to be looking at Elena's combos in which she can get some really good damage with low drive gauge consumption at that making her very resourceful and I feel like really compliments her gameplay but if you guys are enjoying the video and if you're looking to further expand your Street Fighter 6 knowledge or knowledge regarding competitive fighting games as a whole head over to my Metapi at metaphy.gg/ GG/Cusco and join my free coaching community in which I post updates constantly talking about new tips how to handle certain characters and overall fighting game knowledge if you would like one-on-one sessions I can definitely have that arranged as well let's start off for light combos you can do crouching light punch crouching light kick crouching light punch and coral back light kick like so you can go DP afterwards instead if you want to do that you get more damage but you do sacrifice Oki as I'm far away from my you can also do course of the forward light kick but reminder that this only lands if the opponent is standing and not crouching earlier I discussed that her crouch light punch is plus five on hit meaning you can go for stand light kick so you can do two crouching jabs into stand light kick and from there you can go into a heavy DP but you can't do like you can't do a light horse back light kick that won't perk that would work the course to go forward like kick but as long as they're standing so I do like to go for DP if I'm going for damage after the stand light kick and if you want to go for a drive rush combo out of the lights say for instance if you want to go for the kill and dump all your resources or maybe you want to get a little bit more damage and push them closer to the corner you can do a drive rush into jab after these lights as the dry rush jab would be plus nine like that allowing you to combo into her crouching heavy punch which is nine frames and also forces standing so you can actually do this out of stand leg kick as well or if you just wanted to do crouching jabs that will also connect as well so after the crouching jab a drive rush you just want to go into crouch heavy punch and the chorus will go back heavy kick into course of the forward medium kick we discussed Elena's crouching medium kick earlier on in the video in which I was saying that was plus four on hit which does allow you to combo into a down jab or crouching light punch and you can go into course of a back light kick what's great about her crouching medium kick well I use the word great even though that move can definitely use some love is that on counter hit it is plus five so if you are playing in the neutral you can this time cancel it to stand light kick so it's plus four and then it's plus six on counter hit so it's really good if you interrupt someone trying to hit a button you can go for the combo of crouch medium kick it's a stand light kick heavy DP same applies to what we saw earlier you can dump all your resources if you want to do that out of crouching medium punch you can hit confirm and go for Corasoga back medium kick and then you can also go straight into crouching heavy punch if you want to drive rush it like that you get some combos out of her hit confirmable stand heavy punch which are able to go into a heavy DP keep in mind that if you're too far like say if I'm right here it won't connect so you have to be very close to the opponent to get the heavy DP to come out if you're further away from the opponent you can spend two bars of meter to go for two light kicks so if I'm like right here I can do that and it will combo just fine and since you're doing uh EX you're allowed to cancel to level twos when you do EX moves so that does give Elena the ability to go straight into a level two super so from here you can go for full damage or you can heal yourself so Elena can do really good damage off of one drive bar out of a punish counter so say for instance my like exp I block and get the punish counter the target combo three heavy punches are really good in this instance or in this scenario and you can dry rush after and do a combo like that so how I did that combo is that you're going to do the three heavy punch back to back to get the target combo after that's done you're going to drive rush after you're going to do crouching medium punch into chorus back medium kick and then during the chorus back medium kick as we saw earlier we can cancel that into the Linux song which allows her to roll forward gaining options to uh new moves and then you're going to do the forward medium kick after the Linux song which is to have to pop him back up and you're going to go for the DP so it's going to look like this and you can get even more damage if you're closer to the corner after you do the link song for medium kick to get the pop up like that you can actually do core circle for light kick as they're in the midair and as they're falling down you can go for a medium DP if they're into the corner so that's going to look like this it's situational but the more you play lane you're going to get used to seeing it and right there that was 3947 off of one bar drive gauge punish counter and I was like midscreen close to the corner if someone does a uh exper you can get even more damage and I'll show you guys what that looks like 4,133 off of one bar of drive gauge and you didn't even spend any super meter feel free to get creative when dumping all your resources you can get some pretty useful combos out of the target combo she does in the sky with jump medium punch jump heavy punch so you can go for the corso forward two kicks like that you can do a corso forward light kick but it's not 100% consistent depends on the arc of the jump like right there it's going to drop so if you meet her in the skies and jump or fall down a little bit faster than she does then you can't get the Corser for light kicks and what's great about this as well is that say for instance if you're wanting to close out a match or you have a you're anticipating your opponent's jump you can definitely close out games by going straight into level two after the EX course of 42 light kicks or Corso 42 kicks we learned about Elena's moves the properties within those moves as well as some of her combos to score some high damage lastly it's just her strategy in which me as an Atlanta player well an Atlanta pocket I mean Cammy I don't necessarily mean Atlanta at least not yet but I like to harass with stand heavy kick I like to do crush medium kick just to clip them low even though this bun isn't amazing it still does prevent them from being able to walk back comfortably just basically checking them getting plus frames and then chipping away at their uh health gauge the stand light cake as a stop sign in case they try to approach the overhead is good for closing out games and then her anti-airs are very very very good so as long as you sharpen up your skills on air anti-airing when it comes to like DPS you can definitely force them to play the ground game in which they have to deal with this button that deal with that and to like confirms and then the stop sign and crouch medium kick as long as you can apply those tools your Atlanta can definitely be pretty good and then you can also start mixing in the Linux song stuff to um spice things up i'm going to show you guys a couple of footage of me just playing Elena just to show you guys or demonstrate just how I pilot her in actual matches all right oh he's super aggro fun i definitely EXTP excuse me uh not close enough see I'm not really doing much i'm just playing the neutral game threatening with my buttons and then trying to anti him if he tries to jump there we go ah too slow now I'm dead for it oh he messed up oops i got to hit confirm i got a hit confirm in a dream brother a shoot i got it i got it i got it that sucks golly there we go um got me there we go wow hey baby mess up the comma there it's okay ko ah I could have flipped funny if I rolled oh no [Applause] but yeah as you guys can see there I didn't really do anything too flashy i didn't do anything too crazy valina I just mainly you know approach with blocking uh roundhouse like heavy kick i would do crouch medium kicks here and there i would go for whip punishes and then DP with anti-air i mainly just rely on her neutral tools as well as her DP cuz he has really good antiers see there's the antire if they try to jump there's the stop sign stand light kick if they try to approach there's a whip punish uh not good enough oh whoops i did the wrong input there you go you just suffocate him you just walk him down menacingly oops that was an accident so what I'm doing is just suffocating them i'm making them play my game i try not to let them get anything started and I basically try to be a wall and he just one and done he's scared of Elena he won and done that's going to conclude the Elena guide if you made it to the
