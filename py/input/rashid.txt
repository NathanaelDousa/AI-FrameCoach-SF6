Rasheed is a character of high mobility and a plethora of options to approach and keep the pressure on the opponent on top of this he is extremely well-rounded he shares some of the tools that other strong characters in the game have such as an invincible reversal a cancel below crouched medium kick and an install level 2 super if you are looking for a character with a variety of tools with theft to explore look no further than Rasheed and we're going to start with the most important thing when learning a character rasheed's neutral now I think the most signature movie has is his Fireball a scorecircle 4 kick and he has three different versions right and they all go at basically different trajectories but they have the same frame data in general in neutral you're going to be using the light kick version because it goes the furthest however the heavy kick version is pretty good at hedging against jumpins obviously the main weakness of any Fireball move is you can jump over it but you can kind of fake out with the heavy kick version and the medium kick version can be used in a similar way but not you know from like a little bit of distance so generally you want to vary all three but light kick version is probably gonna be the most consistent option when you're trying the Zone with the character but the cool thing about this is you can charge it up so they all go the same trajectory when you charge it up but there's three different stages of charging up the fireball uh the first you hold about halfway and you can kind of tell it has that little um gust at the end but also if you make the opponent block it'll do two hits on block see out those two hits the advantage to charging this up you sometimes do this in combos as better Frame data and it's also really good to fake out a full charge right so what you really want to do with Rasheed is set up a full charge Fireball because it leaves this little tornado gust there at the end like if some people react to the full charge because it's really really slow you can just do the semi charge and kind of beat them into pressing something or trying to approach when you get the full charge out basically enhances a couple of these moves enhances the spin mixer move and enhances this equal kick and what this does is it makes light spin mixer Plus on block most of the time you either go for a throw or you're going for a shimmy so you do something like this be out the throw by just walking back slightly another thing that people like to do is they will walk back a lot after this so you can just do like a slight delayed Crouch menu kick and hit that walk back and the other cool thing about this is that if this hits you actually get a full combo so it's just like you combo and the stand light kick into ego quick afterwards now you can also do the evil kick the main benefit is it's harder to contest but in general it's not as good because on block you just kind of go back to full screen so in my mind I always want to set up this late mixer because I want to be I'm Rasheed I want to be right up in their face when it's my turn now the most common counter play to the situation is that people will jump here's me predicting this is gonna come out and I'll jump back and then I get a full combo right and so this is what you have to be really careful but thankfully Rasheed has a couple ways to deal with this too you can kind of Chase down that jump against back jump you really don't get a punch unfortunately but you can just kind of chase them back to the corner sometimes if they neutral jump you can just ant hair with h mixer the other thing you can do and this is a little tricky though there's some counter play is that your jump also goes way further if you have this tornado out and so you can kind of check them like that but that's pretty much all your options um obviously like this move gets enhanced too but you're not going to want to do that because that's super unsafe the other cool thing is ex Eagle Spike has projectile info so if you're ever like in a fireball Award with Rasheed but you can do that ex Eagle kick to get through and all these Eagle kicks are safe on block when they're enhanced if you just do a random Eagle kick in neutral these are super unsafe slate walk forward the eye and you get a full punch right he also has the ex Fireball this ex Fireball is quite good in neutral it's really good in Fireball Wars right so if you know they're throwing a regular Fireball your ex will go through the other cool thing here is you can just walk behind it you see I'm still plus after I ran behind it so if you want like the easiest neutral skip option with Rasheed is just throwing an ex Fireball and running right behind it alright so let's talk about his other key neutral moves this stand heavy kick this is this move doesn't look very good but it's actually the god button because it's safe on block and it's really good for with punishing right because it goes Super far so if I see Rasheed press something you get a punch counter and off this punish counter you get like 2K damage this move is insanely good and look at the pushback on block a lot of times people will like try to hit something afterwards so let's say Rashid is just pressing his let's say medium kick so you can like space trap with that too very very good button You're Gonna Want to press this button a lot especially looking to whiff push another button you're gonna impress a lot is this Crouch medium kick this goes pretty far but it's canceled and it hits low so you can do something like this and you get a full combo so this is really good just to kind of throw out you can check dashes with it you can catch them walking back with it it's just a good all-purpose poke to throw out for antire with this character you want to do H mixer um he has some moves that look like they can be anti-air like this move but you're I think this move is actually just trolling because it gets it gets beat a lot of the time don't use that um this move is kind of trolling too does very little damage and also just gets beat out some ex mixer is kind of trolling uh you can use as an entire but it's not the best instead you almost always want to use H mixer as long as you do this move early enough it almost always works and the main benefit to hmexor over other antires is it's really good against cross-ups you just have to make sure you input the correct way but if you do it too late then you'll just get hit so in general just be as early as you can be on this move the better the last neutral tip I can give is use Drive Rush um using drivers of any character is really really strong but where she has a few good buttons out of it my favorite one from like close range is crowd kick and on hit you get this crouchly kick Crouch medium kick into Eagle Spike and unblock you know you can you just throw or do whatever Right cmina Punch is also pretty good just because it leads into a lot their damage and it's good because it's it's quite fast stand medium kick is good too it has a lot better range so if you're like trying to do Drive Rush from this range obviously the uh you know your Crouch light kick with whiff driver stand me and kick combos in the stand heavy punch and you get a nice juicy combo for that and if they're not pressing on that stand medium kick what you can do is you can drive Rush forward heavy kick you get a Target combo after the Ford heavy kick but the main benefit is that if they block this your plus right in their face you're literally in throw range and a lot of other Rasheed moves from dry brush they kind of push you out in my mind the goal of Rasheed and drive Rush is to do your fast moves make sure they're not checking you and then when you know they're not gonna check you sneak this in but she has actually some really good defensive options exp is obviously very strong you should be using this occasionally but she has three main defensive buttons Stanley punch Crouch light punch and Crouch medium kick sand light punch is your fastest normal so if you want something just to mash out really quick this is your option crowd slate punch is a little bit slower at five frames but because you're doing it from a crouching position it's probably your best option to do like a delay jab so it's like your anti your anti-chemy button just pressing a delay jab at the right time also if you happen to counter hit them this goes in the Crouch meme kick in the eagle Spike and then you start your mix-up game the other good thing is you can also do delay Crouch meme kick because this will beat walking back so you can do like crash media kick in the spin mixer and you're still safe after obviously block is really important back that's just important against throw Loops the other unique option Rasheed has so you can do tiger knee this flip move and if they slightly Miss time their throw which is typically what happens you can get punished counter you can get out and of course it's level one and level three super are invincible but generally you want to stick to the other options generally don't want to do level 3 super for reversal unless it's gonna kill level 1 super is a lot more meter efficient so Rasheed also has a wall jump it's very good for pretty much only defense so in the corner uh mixing up between just jumping back and then when they start to like try over commit you can get this wall hop off you just press forward after the wall you also do this like full screen too although it's like pretty useless at that point you can also use this I think it's really good um especially if you like do it that Apex secret jump that way if they're trying to like antire you even with like a lot of characters DPS might not necessarily reach up there even if they try the air to air you it'll be really hard for them to catch you all right so let's go over his offense so I'm gonna do this a little bit different we're gonna talk about the combo and then we're gonna talk about what to do after the combo so here's a few combos that kind of lead into the same knockdown and also I'm not going to teach as many combos as a lot of combo guides to do because I don't think as a new player you should be focusing on learning tons of combos just focus on the essential Combos and this will serve you you know until you basically hit Masters so first combo crash medium kick Drive Rush send me a punch to heavy punch Eagle kick you see how that gives you a plus 52 knockdown let's see you hit a jump in you can go into Target combo he has an mphk Target combo core Circle back and to jump heavy kick plus 52 knockdown right and the third thing that gives you something very similar is your post di knockdown so jump heavy kick for media punch HK Eagle Spike plus 53 but it's still the same so because all the frame advantages are pretty similar you can do the same options on lockdown right so there's a few different options you can do probably the best if you're a beginner because this is the most foolproof is just do a charge like kick Fireball this can be beat right they can do invisible reversal they can jump out there's a few things they can do here you can do a charge Fireball and then if they get hit you get a full combo and even if they block right you just get a bunch of corner carry and your plus two another really good option is you can do Dash into Arabian cyclone and it's a raven cycling we need to talk about is this 214 punch series move it's three different versions The Light punch starts up the fastest the heavy punch starts up the slowest but the main benefit to the heavy version is that if you press forward and kick after your plus one on block which means it's your turn um if you do that for the light and medium versions uh you just get punished the light medium versions do have some use though the medium punch version is mainly used in combos you can you can link after it but it's just a little bit more advanced we'll cover that later and the light punch version It's if you want to get quick access to the follow-up this is the quickest you can do the follow-up it's actually used for some okay steps we'll talk about later too [Music] right so you're plus five after that because it hits midi so it's really tricky on that the other thing you can do if you want to be a little cheeky is he can go for like a a different version and he can go for the back fall up to Arabian mixer and you could do a mix-up he actually screams the mix up because the idea is you could go for an overhead or you can whiff a jump light punch and then go for a throw or with a light punch and go for a go for a load right so you can start to mix that in but that takes a little bit of conditioning to make them respect the plus frames after this and of course the other thing you could do after any knockdown including the stock down is go for strike throw if you're gonna go for strike my recommendation is do a crash medium punch the cool thing about Crash medium punch is this is plus one on block which means if they Mash you get a combo the most common thing to do after crash medium punch is either throw or you can do stand light kick if crash mean punch hits you can go into stand light kick into late Eagle Spike and if they Mash you can get a combo here so you can do like stand light kicks and light punch into light mixer or media mixer another really good media option is you can this is really good for catching walk back do five light punch two light kick and then stand light punch again so something like that is really good and then if you want a shimmy obviously all those options lose to delay throw attack so if you want to beat a delay throw attack you just walk back and stand heavy punch so you should be punished like something like this so 3K for a shimmy and then you get pretty good Okie after that too and the cool thing is after they block the sand heavy punch you can mix up in a few different ways right so if they're mashing you can just cancel the into a roll one shot you almost always want to use the heavy kick rolling shot because you're you're the most plus after and heavy kick roll one shot you can do a lot of nasty stuff after so for example this is plus one on block if you're spaced like even better that's plus three on block so you can kind of just keep looping this and you can get some really cool spacing chaps going there the main thing that they can beat though is they can just jump out they could punish you for it so you have to be a little careful the other thing you could obviously just do stand heavy punch and hair the jump or you can if you want to be really greedy stand heavy punch into heavy Arabian cyclone dashboard and then get your plus one unblocked throw attempt or strike attempt all right so there's two other knockdown situations and combos that we need to learn the second one is from a around the plus three knockdown so this is gosh like kid crash medium kick in the eagle Spike and you see how you're plus 30 right now plus 30 is a magic number in this game because if you do dry brush into overhead that overhead hits midi so there's a couple other situations this happens if you do H mixer like is it anti-air you're around like plus 33 plus 36 it's pretty close so you could just delay your dry brush slightly or anytime you come with a medium mixer so something like this your plus 31. so on these knockdowns I recommend almost always drive rushing dry brush overhead really really strong easy to get full combo from this it'd be smashing you just go into Target combo into each Arabian Cyclone into jump heavy kick keep in mind for H mixer you have to slightly delay the overhead but you can still get to hit meaty you have a few other options right so of course they're gonna expect the overhead so some people like the Perry so doing something like Drive rush in the throw to beat the Perry is really strong the other thing you could do is you can go drive Rush low so you can do something like this you can also do that low combo we talked about before but I recommend always drive rushing after that knockdown as long as it won't burn you out and you still have a little bit drop gauge to spare so if you don't drive Russian they back tech you don't you don't really get anything good you need to spend dry brush on these knockdowns in order to get a good mix up now there's one last situation I want to cover and that's Target combo in the corner very easy comma to do here is mphk in the H Eagle Spike you get a lot more damage but the main benefit is that you're plus 67 on lockdown which means that you can do some really cool things so doing this into back bash jump heavy kick is a safe jump that means they can't DP there the other cool thing you can do here is you do late Arabian cyclone and then you could go for a 50 50. you can either go high or you can whiff the um the jump and again go low right right so you see how you see the potential here you can just kind of keep looping this mix up of course you can do empty jump throw if they Parry if you time the overhead version right it will beat a DP okay so a few other Niche combos um you can use stand medium kick as a poke as well and sometimes you'll get a counter hit I'll counter hit this links into itself and same thing with punish counter punch counter you are plus 10 so you know theoretically if you're close enough you can link this another situation that counter hits really important to confirm is if you ever get this move um you see how this is plus six on counter hit so that means you can link into a stand medium punch it's a Target combo into a combo of your choice and the last thing is you want to make sure you know how to combo up to level three so generally if you cancel the first hit is spin mixer that's a really good confirm um the way I cheat and I'll do a core Circle forward spin mixer and then I'll do the second quarter circle into level three so I'm not inputting Three core Scrolls I'm only inputting two it's a little shortcut you can take and the other place if you want to be like really optimal off of like a medium Punch or something go into if you go into medium Arabian Sky you can cancel the level three all right so let's talk about his other tools and other things you need to know and we'll first start with the 214 kick Series in the air while we talked about so ex is obviously the best um you can actually direct it so if you hold back he doesn't go very far but if you hold forward you go super far and if you just do it normally he goes somewhat far right he also has three versions I don't think this move is the best I thought this move was gonna be like extremely good but the issue is that anytime this Rasheed does it you just go in the air and like hit them out or if you have like a really high hitting Dragon punch you can do that too so like Rasheed like doesn't really have to worry about this in the mirror but it can be good against some characters like let's say Jamie that has a really low hitting DP you can kind of like do that to bait the DP and then you can jump in I'm not the biggest fan of this move but it does have some use just to be tricky you have this flip move it's four plus two kicks the cool thing is like if you do two kicks again you could do another flip and you can also steer this jump and so this could be really tricky if you get the space to do it this can be really like a surprise to a lot of zoners and like dealing with antirring this angle plus ant hiring this angle can be really tricky the the hard part is just getting this out but it's really good like as a surprise move just to throw out neutral against like zoners or if you're trying to escape the corner like that's really hard to deal with he has a run by the way so every character in the scheme has like a dash but rasheed's special he has a run and you can do two moves out of this run he has a slide move that is pretty good it hits low you don't get anything off of it unless it's punch counter which only really happens against like a fireball and you can get level one after which is really really cool you can also get EX mixer too depends on distance it's really like finicky you have to be pretty close but yeah you can get that too so pretty good move um he has this run move as well I don't recommend using this move very much outside of combos because this is unsafe on block but where I could see it potentially being used is it's actually throw in full so if like they delay throw Tech they get hit and then they get a full combo right seems really risky to me but if you could set it up then go for it a couple other normals we didn't talk about is sweep I think it sleeps like kind of trash not gonna lie like most sleeps it's really good for punishing other characters sweeps because you don't really get any other Punisher I guess you could do stand medium kick but you don't get much off of that um and nothing else is fastened up to the punish by the way you made it this far in the guide and you found this useful please consider subscribing to the channel it really helps us out it helps us make more guides like this of course I stream as well on Twitch we have a Discord like the video comment if you have more questions Etc but if you made this far please consider supporting the content two H is as far as reaching normal the issue is it's not canceled so you don't really get much unless you have level 1 super and you're really God like you hit confirmed that into level one super you get quite a good a mad damage it can also be used in the level 2 super as well um but I think usually level two super is generally better for um neutral control unless you know that's gonna kill now of course you can do level three super as well but um I don't think it's the best normal I haven't quite implemented in my game plan yet but I could see this being in really good fishing like especially if you have level one and your hiccup firms are really on point oh wait actually it's not even as far as reaching normal I'm trolling this is this is further reaching so like a lot of times where like I could use this I'm basically just using this instead because this is such a good width Punisher and it doesn't cost me to convert off of all right so let's talk about is um level one super it's just your standard impulse super you're not going to use it much outside of a reversal or comboing from this or unless it's gonna kill level two now this is where the sauce is at this super is super sick super fun to play around with um you get the tornado out it lasts a really long time it hits and then you have this like enhanced tornado similar to what you would get for a Charged Fireball there's a few ways to play this right I think activating it when they're near close to the corner like this is really strong because you get multiple mix-up opportunities and they can't they can't really uh back off right by the way if this tornado ever hits um you pretty much always use ex mixer after and then you can go meterless where you go into that jump two H and then you do H mixer ah that combo is really tricky so the combo I recommend you learning is this hits exert and the ex214k and then you just do H mixer when you land and you get about 4K from that very good costs a little bit of drive but it's totally worth it some of the other options you have while this is out of course everything becomes enhanced so just doing this is really good but you kind of lose the tornado so you don't really want to do that right away Eagle Spike becomes good but you know some people at high level are really good at reacting to this because it is pretty slow so what I recommend is just trying to play like the the strike throw game like dashboard grab them okay now you're getting their opportunity now I do the mixer at nine plus two unblock you can play something like that uh the roll through is really good as well so you can do like this and this goes really far the other cool thing is you can actually kick the tornado at them too so like you play this mix up and like let's say they're trying to jump back I'm scared okay I get hit by the tornado and then you get a full combo right all right the only thing I didn't talk about were jumping normals um jump light kick uh I think this is useless you generally never can use jump light kick jump light punch probably the best air to air it's also good for making your jumping whiff and then you go go low on those Mix-Ups jump medium kick really good bet your best cross up jump me and punch is a really good air to air so if you need like a preemptive air-to-air this combo is an ex and you get really good damage from Air to air right so you get air air combos jump heavy kick probably your best jumping jump heavy punch is also pretty good too the double hit like screws me up sometimes so I generally don't do it and the second it's not even the overhead anyways so I recommend just sticking with jump heavy kicks for simplicity's sake but I guess this could also throw a opponent off you also have this jump 2H this is a pretty cool normal it's really tricky but this was pretty good in the corner you can do some cool Mix-Ups like that you can also like autocorrect into this and do some really cheap stuff but the thing is like I don't recommend like learning this because like it's kind of gimmicky like especially if you have like a good Crouch like a good anterior normal I guess her she is actually probably pretty good because like he doesn't have like a great way to deal with that yep but I feel like Kim could just like crash heavy punches every time and you have to deal with it all right so Advanced section and this is mostly gonna be all combo related where she actually has a ton of different combo routes that we didn't cover in this and some of them are useful some of them are very Niche but I think one of the most useful routes is being able to spend ex meter in a combo if you ever need to extend like a drive Rush combo you can do that Crouch heavy punch stand heavy punch into whatever but for a combo like this you actually can spend ex meter and you can do run after and so I think this combo is really good in the corner where you can get a corner juggle so you get a lot of extra damage for Just Two Bar that combo is really good another situation that might be pretty good let's say you get a stand heavy punch and you're just buffering it instead of buffering into this which says 2100 you can do a cross-up with ex ego Spike and then you can get another Eagle Spike 400 extra for two bar that's pretty decent but you get you know you get the corner carry from it too and we have a ton of Twitter Tech to show you guys so like I said Rasheed has some crazy combos this is one of the more crazy combos that Rashid has oh um how practical this is I'm not sure but just to kind of show you the combo potential of the character um it it's really insane it's it's absolutely insane this probably a little more practical this is Max damage so anytime you land this in the corner you get Hella damage and of course that means you're enhanced which means you get this which means you're getting our ex move which means you get a flippy kick and then you get that link at the end the level three and you're almost doing AK so yeah Rashid doesn't do much damage I I don't know about that especially on the right hit you you do some of the best damage in the game um here's an example of another Rasheed High loot Suite uh concept so this gives you a little bit more damage and you also get a midi low here so in order to make it a true high low the low is meaty and if you delay the overhead it can also be me this is another example of a meaty setup the idea being here is that you'd probably do this like when your combo is really scaled and you need another mix-up to kill and it can also safe jump so there's a lot of these setups that I think people will start to figure out that really bring out the mix-up potential of Rasheed all right so one thing we did throw Oaky and mid screen you don't really get through okay you can kind of do um like a Charged Fireball or something but you really don't get that much but in the corner you can just dashboard and you can get a throw but this is interesting Tech from dogra where if you dashboard and you do a Crouch medium punch which is your best meaty uh it whiffs right but if you hold down back after your dash you see how there's the down back there your dash is one frame longer which makes your Crouch medium punch a perfect meaty so after throw that's typically what I mix up with I either do dashboard throw dashboard Crouch medium Punch or Dash up walk back stand heavy punch anyways guys thank you so much for watching if this guide was helpful at all consider subscribing to the channel really helps us out helps us grow helps us make more content like this like and comment and share the video if you want to help support I am playing Rasheed I'll probably play him as an all right now I'm still meeting Kim but I think Rashid is a better character than Kim at least in this patch because you basically came with the ex reversal so I might be making the switch after Evo we'll see but if you want to keep up with the grind follow me on Twitter twitch and that sort of thing anyways take care y'all peace
