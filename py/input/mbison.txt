hey what's up everybody today I'm going to show you everything you need to start playing mbison as effectively and powerfully as possible in no time at all I'm trying to keep this guide short so let's get right into it m bison's basic game plan outside of mid-range you'll want to use bison's light and medium double knee press to control space they're both minus five on block but you'll be left at a safe distance if you space them properly now you can close the Distance by using his Drive Rush from neutral as it's the fastest in the game at close ranges use crouching medium punch and crouching medium kick to fish for counter hits and to whiff punish your opponents you can also use his command jump Shadow rise to bait out antiair or to quickly approach from far away and confuse your opponent with front back mixups bison's wind condition is to land a combo that ends with double combination near the corner this puts a bomb on the opponent and allows bison to get huge damage combos on hit while all of bison's normals are useful there are five normals that you'll want to build your basic game plan around crouching light punch crouching medium punch crouching medium kick standing Hard Punch and back hard kick crouching light punch is bison's best four-frame normal it's minus two on block but it leaves you in range for a tick throw his backwalk speed is slow but it's just fast enough to do a shimmy off of a blocked crouching light punch on counter hit crouching light punch gives you enough frame advantage to link into a crouching medium punch crouching medium punch crouching medium punch has insane reach and can be used as both a longrange poke and a with punish it's fast at six frames and it's only minus one on block poking with this from tip range and going into light double knee press is a great way to chip away at Drive gauge against opponents with stubby normals since bison will be left at a spacing where he can't be punished by these characters crouchy medium kick crouchy medium kick is M bison's go-to low poke the range is pretty good but be careful careful because it's minus 6 on block so make sure you only use it from tip range you'll want to use this move similarly to crouching medium punch but remember that crouching medium kick has less range than crouching medium punch this is one of his best normals to cancel into drive Rush with standing Hard Punch this move is one of bison's two plus on block normals you'll be left at plus one if the opponent blocks now standing Hard Punch can be super cancelled this makes the move pretty good against drive impact in neutral you'll mostly be using this move in knockdown setups after Drive rush and to fish for stray hits after making your opponent block a spaced double knee press back hard kick this is M bison's other Plus on block normal you'll generally be using this move as a media attack after knocking down your opponent or from neutral Drive Rush After knockdowns to get massive plus frames and set up strike throw shimmy mixups so your first goal when learning mbison is learning how to combo into light or medium double knee press and and what to do after they hit you can combo into the light version from a light string or the medium version from any medium button it's more common to land the light version in matches so let's just focus on that the light version leaves you point blank on hit and at plus two frames after the light version hits you generally have four options you can do nothing and block to Beta reversal this will give you the highest reward since bison's punish counter damage is just Bonkers you can go for a throw and this will beat opponents who push buttons Parry or block but it loses to invulnerable reversals and jumps you can also push crouching light punch this will counter hit opponents who push buttons or try to move if they pushed a button or went for a throw you can combo into crouching medium punch into any combo of your choice or to keep things simple you could just push crouching light punch twice and hit confirm into another light double knee press to Loop the exact same situation and last you can always go for a shimmy this is great against opponents who like to do delayed throw Tech after getting hit by light double knee press anti-airs now bison generally has three anti-airs but remember that he doesn't have a true sh yukin style anti-air special your main anti-air is going to be crouching heart punch this is your go-to anti-air when you don't have charge and opponents jump at you from mid-range now there are some ranges where crouching Hard Punch won't work in these situations you'll want to react to the opponent's jump jump yourself and use his medium medium Target combo in the air you can follow this up midscreen and in the corner with his double knee press or his psycho Crusher psycho Crusher can be canceled into his critical art for massive damage so definitely go for this if you have the bar if you have charge you can always antier with either light or OD cycle Crusher this is a bit tricky to do especially if you're new to charge characters but it's a good anti-air so learn to do it if you can throw Loops andison has throw Loops yay you have two ways to set up a throw Loop in the corner you you can do an auto time throw Loop by immediately dashing forward after throw to be left at plus two frames you can either throw again or push crouching light punch for a media attack this setup will not give you enough time to walk backwards for a shimmy now the second and best way to set up throw Loops is to use a manual timing after throw hold forward and then time a throw to hit mey this is harder to do than the auto Time Dash setup but you'll be able to shimmy with a back walk with this manual setup this is definitely worth learning so I recommend spending time in training mode practicing this midscreen throws unfortunately mbison can't get a true throw mixup midscreen after a throw even after using dyve rush if you land a forward throw midscreen you can drive Rush forward and then use back hard kick to take plus frames on blocking opponents or land a counter hit against opponents who push buttons on wake up this will lose to invulnerable reversals of course if you think your opponent is going going to try to reversal cancel your drive rush to make the reversal whiff and then go for a punish Drive Rush cancels so you'll generally want to use either crouching medium Punch or crouching medium kick to drive cancel crouching medium kick is a low so let's focus on that for this guide like any other character you'll want to use the screen flash during Drive cancel to check if your crouching medium kick was blocked or if it hit on block I recommend following up with a crouching light punch since this is a gapless string now crouching light punch will leave you at plus two frames in this situation which means you can do a strike throw shimmy mix here and this is the exact same strike throw shimmy mix after a light double knee press so just do the same thing you did there here if crouching medium kick hits follow up with standing medium punch into crouching Hard Punch into the Ender of your choice essential Oki setups midscreen you have a choice to make do you keep the pressure on with double knee press or do you put a bomb on the opponent by ending with backfist combo now in my opinion ending combos with a light backfist combo isn't worth doing midscreen because you won't really be able to pressure your opponent after I recommend going for light double knee press Enders midscreen but you should go for back fist combo Enders if you can connect the medium or hard versions since mbison can use Drive Rush after these versions to keep the pressure going after landing either medium or hard backfist combo immediately Drive Rush forward into standing Hard Punch this will leave you at massive plus frames on block you have a few options here you can walk forward and throw you can do Crouch medium punch into medium back fist combo which will set up a strike throw shimmy pressure on block or you can cancel into OD cycle Crusher for massive damage or massive plus frames now bison has a lot of Combos and setups he can use but I'm going to leave you with what I think are the most important ones you should learn I won't talk for these so this way you can watch them without being annoyed by my voice here we go and that's it for this primer guide if you found it helpful please hit the like button and consider subscribing as it
