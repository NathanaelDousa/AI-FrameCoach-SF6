you probably clicked on this guide because you wanted to learn about Akuma my pitch for why you should play him he has all the tools you would want in the character a great Fireball way to neutral skip with air Fireball and Demon flip great normals like forward heavy punch and Crouch mem kick coupled with amazing walk speed great damage and he just looks badass the big trade-off is he has a th000 lower Health than the second lowest Health character in the game which basically turns him into a glass can archetype I want start this guy basic start how a play him the neutral and we go on more complex things as the video goes on time stamps below feel free to skip forward but let's get started all right because Akuma is so versatile his neutral is a little more complicated to play than let's say Honda where you just have to spam headbutt and butt slam and now he has a couple other pokes that you can use Akuma I like to think of it has three different modes that you have to operate them one is your zoning gate the reason this Fireball is good is because you know you could charge it up and he has he has a lot of speed variety right this is his fastest his heavy punch Fireball his slowest is his light punch Fireball and because you can vary his projectiles this makes his zoning game strong the other thing that also makes the zoning game strong is the whole point of the fireball is to force your opponent to jump because the way you beat a fireball is jumping over it and Kuma has some great antir probably the go-to antire is his heavy punch DP does the most damage I see some people use his medium punch I see some people use his light punch they're a little easier because they they start up quicker but if you want the most damage uh most people are using heavy punch Crouch heavy punch works you know if like in a pinch uh the issue is the you see how you're pretty far from your opponent you don't really get a good mixup after and it does less damage uh sometimes if you do it like really late you can get a cancel but uh it's really inconsistent so yeah there you can do something like that but uh it's really in consistent so most people stick with the the dragon punch the third thing that you can do for antire is back heavy kick uh this thing is really good but you have to do it really early cuz if you do it too late you're just going to get hit out right same timing on the DP uh easy peasy every time but the main benefit is you get a lot more damage on this just a basic combo like this where you go into charge Fireball Drive Rush heavy punch into whatever you want and they're in the corner and they took a bunch of damage right so it's anti-airs are great and you can kind of play this zoning Fireball game uh the issue is this Fireball game doesn't work again against everyone right some characters have really really good tools uh some characters can just outzone you so you need a couple other ways to play the character and of course you can use your Fireball against anyone think of it as like a very long range poke like especially on the mid-range uh where like let's say they're whiffing a bun you throw the fireball to beat their butt doesn't matter what mode you operate akuman Fireball is still going to have used cuz it's really good the second way you'll want to play auma neutral is just walking people down with your strong buttons right six heavy punch this button is the goat this is the go-to button with Akuma in my opinion and the reason is it's basically his farthest reaching button but also it's hi perable if you see them get hit you can press heavy punch heavy kick again you basically did a fifth of their health and you get a knockdown situation right you can just drive Rush after him and then you can do whatever you want so this normal is really good and just to show you guys this is how you should practice it too is put the dummy on random guard and then whenever they get hit go into the Second Heavy punch and whenever they block you don't do anything the two things you should really practice are making sure you get your anes down and making sure you can hit confirm this every time because if you do un block uh yeah you're super unsafe on counter hit you actually can get like something like this you want to crack out a little bit extra damage and on punish counter you're plus eight which means you get Crouch heavy punch and then you go into Coral back heavy in the corner this is like brutal because you get extra damage off the course of back heavy uh he has a couple other really good tools his crou medium kick is very strong the main reason crou Med kicks is strong is because they hit low and couple of akuma's really really good walk speed you can catch people that are just like walking back and then you can get your combo of your choice another really strong thing about crou me kick is Akuma Fireball is actually really good to cancel into and the light Fireball if you space it out enough you're actually can be slightly plus as you see this is plus one um and you can obviously mix up with the Fireballs but they're all pretty much safe so if you don't have the drive to commit to drive cancelling the Crouch medium kick just cancel the fireball I usually default the light but you have you got to be a little careful cuz there was a gap they could perfect Parry or something like that a couple really good neutral tools six medium kick this button is uh it's pretty nice it goes far it's like think of as like a lower reward but lower risk version of six heavy punch so if you just want to like control the spacing with like and be able to hedge against like anti people like just blocking uh six medium kicks are really good for that uh you can also on punish counter you can link a sweep if you have to be at the right distance some people when they're also walking people down they'll they'll use stand jab just because it's really quick and there's not really much risk throwing this out compared to some other buns U obviously your your reward is going to be a lot lower uh but it just has a really good hit box of people do this and you can't really get much from just one stand jab let's say you get a counter hit on this you can go into you can go into a confirm like that so if you're looking to whiff punish you can either do stand heavy punch like H this this goes into your core Circle back heavy Punch or you can do to medium punch same idea and you can also Drive brush these buttons as well and get a full combo too all right and then the third mode of Akuma is what I would call like the YOLO mode right so Akuma has some pretty good ways to neutral skip air Fireball is a very very good neutral skip so let's just say I'm trying to anti Akuma all right I anti Akuma let me try anti it again I got hit right and a lot of characters the main way you encounter this is you just try to anti it like as late as possible you're waiting for the normal jump you're going to want to antire early you might hit them especially if you're at the wrong range so there's a lot of like counterplay Akuma can do with the fireball just some general tips for the fireball usually the further you are out the better so a fireball like this uh pretty good because they can't really anre you right there's three different spacings light goes the how I say the closest to you heavy goes the furthest um mix up your spacing they don't change up too much but you want to mix up your Fireball timings right something like this is unlikely to bait a normal antire but something like this is a lot more likely to beit a normal antire but it's a lot more like to lose the DP right if they have a move that can go through it like a dragon punch try to use it less or try to do it spacings where they aren't able to get under the fireball like that um you also have ex Fireball same idea this this move is really good think of it is like especially when you when you do it lower the ground it's really really strong and you get a combo after so this could be good just like neutral skip or if they're like if you know they're going to good for DP uh it's a lot better at stuffing out DPS and you get a lot more reward all right the second YOLO move is demon flip now demon flip is really strong there's three versions light medium heavy medium goes a little bit further than the heavy and heavy goes really far right you have the overhead which you just press punch and you can delay these follow-ups too so if you want to get like a like I don't know like a kind of a mixup you can do delayed overhead or you can go into low speaking of which the low is when you just let go of the controller and you'll do the low the low is also Plus on block so basically if they're blocking this thing you're perfectly fine with it that's the whole goal just to use this to get in and you also have the dive kick now the dive kick can be minus right there's also not a high low component to attach to it you might be thinking why would I do that well the whole point is if it hits you can get a combo right so obviously depends where the dive kick hits as you can see the frame Advantage changes especially if they're standing but in general like my my recommendation is just go into a couple Jabs and if it happens combo it combos he also has the ex demon flip air ex demon flip and the air ex Fireball is very very strong it only uses two bars and you can do the same thing like you would off of the regular air ex Fireball the last move I want to talk about neutral is this teleport now this teleport's a little gimmicky I call this like a YOLO move because you're literally throwing your life away it's not like an actual teleport like this old teleports you can just hit them out of it on reaction you can also just jump it but the whole point point this move is you could cancel a Teleport into the throw input and if they are just sitting there they'll get thrown and this does a chunk of damage it actually pairs very well with the fireball game so if you're throwing a lot of fireballs you'll notice that people start the Parry right and when they start the parry and if if you think they're going to react like if they just reacting to everything with a Parry they might react to Startup of the teleport with a Parry you grab them you do a bunch of damage uh one other thing that normally I talk about for characters but Akuma is actually lacking in this department is driver Rush Kuma doesn't have the best buttons out of Drive rush I think honestly his best buttons probably stand jab but as you can see it does not go very far and I I think the best thing to combo into after this is just the stand medium kick uh because let's say they're crouching this will for stand and then you can go into the Tatu or whatever you need same thing with Crouch medium kick this works as well forward heavy punch works as well if you want to use that and if you're close obviously you can get Crouch heavy punch for a little extra damage in my opinion you should be spending a lot of your ex gauge on the two versions of the EX air Fireball and just normal into the Dy rushion to mix up so the ideal Akuma uses one of these three Styles or three modes to kind of play neutral right so against you know in the mirror you want to obviously be very Fireball heavy and walk them down with pokes um against characters without a DP you know obviously can rely on air Fireball a lot more and then characters that can Zone you out let's say someone like JP obviously like air Fireball is going to be really good you want to use Drive rush but you also want to walk people down with pokes and rely Less on your Fireball all right so let's talk about offense and combos uh we'll go combos first and the main thing to be aware of is C watching Combos and standing combos for this character are different that doesn't really apply to a lot of characters but it does apply to Akuma the main thing is Tatsu specifically medium and light Tatu do not work on crouching characters so if they're crouching you either need to stand them up with something like stand medium kick crouching heavy Punch or you need to confirm into something like 214 light Punch or DP DP is more optimal uh specifically heavy punch DP but it's a little harder to especially if you're new so you can always just go into 24 LP but I'll be using DP for this context stand light kick has the most range so it's really good for uh like jab chains here if they are standing though you get Tatsu which is really nice and then after the Tatsu you get sweet actually it does a little less damage but your knockdown situation is a lot better if you want to get a mixup off this you have to to dry rush if you want a mix-up Situation off this you just Double Dash and you R in their face the mixup is really simple just like any other character once you get this Double Dash in their face you either do strike throw shimmy strike is your stand medium punch this is plus four on hit which means you can just keep looping the same sequence [Music] right so if someone likes the mash this is this is how you blow up people that smash right or if people like to jump on wake up or if people like to di or anything that scrub players like to do this is how you blow it up um same thing Double Dash in the throw beats mash it beats di it beats all types of options right now the thing that this doesn't beat or these two options don't beat are people doing a delay throw Tech neither these beat people mashing invincible wakeups so that's where the shimmy option comes into play and thankfully because akuma's back walk speed is so good you can just walk back and your walk back shimmy five heavy punch and the core CLE back heavy and then here you can either throw a fireball or if you want to be aggressive just go in the drive rush and repeat the same situation over there's a few other important comments you need to learn M screen if you're ever doing like let's say you need to crack out a little extra damage on the lights you go Crouch light Crouch heavy and then you go Tatu right and then same combo and that forces stand so you don't need to worry about fing after standing or crouching so medium kicks have a little less hits done or Crouch medium kicks have a little less head St just because they're that good so here you have to go Crouch medium punch into Crouch heavy and then same combo right and then any other medium or heavy you do fourward heavy punch and the two heavy punch similar idea it just does a little bit extra damage if you want to attack on a super you just do it after the top to so all the supers work I I would honestly not spend these supers unless they're going to kill the opponent or they're really close to burning out like if you're not going to win the round don't spend level three if you're going to win the round without level three then don't spend the level three but same idea except you just cancel the the level three from your light DP and this works for uh CA as well in the corner your offense looks very similar so like at take any knockdown for example uh you can go for another throw throw Loops are very strong because there's not much you can do other than like invisble reversal out or try to jump out uh the other option you have is trying to go for a shimmy so just let's say they get hit same idea go into Super if you have it and if you need it to kill so Kum is really privileged he gets a lot of frame Advantage after a dash which means you can do some cool stuff like you can do Dash five heavy punch get a combo on hit more on counter hit Dash back heavy kick charge into ex Fireball do a combo I really like this Dash into ex Fireball because not charge ex Fireball you're plus two which means you get a free throw so you can just like keep looping this sequence I really like this and then let's say they finally decide to like Tech you know do a shimmy there's one other combo I think is worth learning this is like your max damage so if you really want to punish something hard let's say it's a DP sometimes you might not have time just use like just use like five heavy kick and you can get something really really basic like this but if you want to be really optimal I think you all yeah all you get really is this one last thing in the corner this ex fire is really good off of Crouch medium punch or something or let's say you get a drive Rush combo back heavy kick charge Fireball heavy kick Tatu all right couple quick Corner steps I just wanted to share so after any light Tatu you can uh hold up forward press the jump normal and that is a safe jump so it will beat DPS as long as you're holding back now this does technically work midscreen but I don't recommend it let's say they just happen to block your Mix-Ups not really that great are pretty spaced away from you the other setup is after any heavy Tatu with a stand medium kick and you get the same situation as you did before we can do either a throw stand medium Punch or back walk the shim me so a couple other offense related things you know midscreen whenever or anytime you go for a drive rush you can do Drive Rush overhead to the combo for Punch medum Kick Tatsu do your Oki rinse and repeat a couple other things on offense if you're really lazy on your shimmies and you don't see that that like if you can't hit confirm this which you can by the way hit confirm this into corcle back medium I think it's a little harder to take confirm of the cor CLE back heavy but if you want to be lazy you can go into cor CLE back heavy and it's only minus two so it's not really the worst thing you have a lot RPS you can do you can try try to Parry you can try to Mash you could you know just block so just doing this on block is not the worst thing there's also like some situations where like let's say your opponent is mashing a button you can do core cirle back heavy to force them to respect your spacing and then you just get pretty basic combo like that right if you want to destroy new players stand medium kick and to stand heavy kick this actually hits as an overhead and and it's safe and then on hit your plus you can just keep doing it it's not really real because they can just Mash after um you can stop the mash like with something like corle back medium and also the low is way slower so there's not really a mixup but you want to be new players that's kind of your gimmick for this section so after you get them to block let's say a stand medium punch on knockdown or just like a jab string you actually have a few different options you know you can obviously do like stand medium punch go for a throw stand medium punch jab the frame trap stand medium punch go for a shimmy and those are just basic uh things that other characters have but you do have a couple other options on block mainly the demon flip is really really strong especially if they're not reacting to it and all the demon flip follow or plus if they Parry you just hold down and then throw them the other cancel option you have is Fireball right so anytime you're worried about them like checking you after a couple Jabs you can just cancel in the Fireball the other option you have is you can cancel the corar circle back heavy and because you kind of like lean back a little bit you might be able to get a punish counter into a full combo all right so section three on defense now Akuma has multiple different things for defense right teleport is not a defensive tool don't use it on wake up but you have extp right extp two bars it's invol one of the best extp because it does the most damage after extp hits you can just kind of throw a fireball or you can try to drive rush in for a little bit more pressure but you don't have the best situation some a lot of characters actually get a better knock down after expdp all the other Universal options apply um you know delay Tech delay jab just block jump out jump down medium kick I think is also decent in the corner right so if they like happen to go for a throw cross something might be ready to cross cut well this kind of forces the issue and they you might hit them like trying to Tire you or something like that his best buts on defense Crouch light right the reason when you do Crouch light over stand light is because you want to be able to block low at the same time the best all up to crouch light especially if you're do it on defense you want to make sure you confirm this in the combo best thing you can do is St light kick into Tatu or you know if they're crouching you can go with the cor Circle back L punch on counter hit this links in the Crouch medium punch so if you happen to like interrupt them and you need that additional range a lot of people will like just dial this in instead and you get pretty much the same combo except after Crouch medium punch course cirle back medium punch works as well there's two other buttons you might want to press defensively take for example a situation like this um this is not a true block string right so you can Mash Crouch me punches Crouch me punch is very good to mash and pressure and then you can drive cancel into whatever you want right so very very good button to mash the other button you might want to mash is Crouch medium kick now having cancelable Crouch medium kick is really good because if someone's trying to shimmy you right doing a defensive like Crouch medium kick very strong and I would just always almost always drive cancel this cuz if especially if you're trying to bust out of pressure uh you should be using it of course you can also if you don't have the drive just cancel the fireball force them to stop shimmying you and that way you can you know block things out more and it'll open up throw Tech and that sort of thing so another option Akuma has is wake up Drive reversal but I don't really recommend it just because there's some cheeky things that people can do to like bait it out uh but extb doesn't work against those right the only time I would like consider doing wake up Drive reversal as someone's like shimmying a lot and they're just autop piloting their shimmy uh then you might be able to catch them with the wake up Drive reversal instead but I mean that's kind of high level I I would honestly just stick with the xtp uh the only other thing we did talk about is checking Drive rush I guess this kind of Defense related I think Crouch medum punch is the best for this and you know you can just do the same combo that you were doing before it's such like a awkward combo for me okay yeah you can do the same combo before and uh check those Drive rushes I don't think his driver check is the best and you do have to be a little on point like for example I think the Jabs are not the best to check Drive Rush with but yeah if your if your reactions are on point then crou me punch is definitely definitely the way to go especially in Street figh 6 it's designed that every tool kind of has a use and so I want to make sure we kind of cover every move because in order for you to become a stronger Kuma you eventually have to use all the tools now obviously you should start with the strongest tools first that we talked about before but let's talk about some of the other things that this character has so we talked about supers to kind of tack on extra damage they do have some utility so for example ex Fireball this combos you can combo into level one super you think this would be kind of hard to hit confirm but if you see them like throw out a uh regular Fireball at the right timing there we go you can just hit confirm like that all right so you also have the air Fireball for some reason it's on Kick but same idea I don't see people use this much just like some really sweaty combos the only time I see people do this is like after jump medium punch but these combos are like kind of hard and I see a lot of people instead just go for ex Fireball into you know into whatever here level one super also has invulnerability so you can kind of phase through things which is kind of nice so especially if you're in Burnout this is one of the supers you can go for a level two super is also really good for br just because it's un core so go back so you can kind of like buffer this and then you see them press something you can just press the punch button right this also has a lot of invol so like for example in the in this near match that you'll probably be playing a lot you can actually super through the air Fireball get a full pretty good damage off that the other main benefit is in the corner Corner this is actually a better super so the super wall bounces which is super nice and you can just do a really easy combo like this uh you get you attack on a little over a th000 damage so really really good in the corner often times I see people cancel the level three most the time unless level two is going to kill and it's particularly used a lot after this ex pal because you can cancel the ex palm and then you can just do the same exact combo that we just showed right so the whole point of EX p is that you actually get a followup in the corner uh midscreen that doesn't really do much of course you get a follow up after the heavy version as well but the main benefit is that this is faster so it means it's more hit confirmable right so for example stand heavy punch you can delay your cancel hit confirm into ex and then get a full combo it also combos from mediums as well uh so you can tack on a little extra damage from that level three pretty much always using it for combos of course you can use as a reversal but it's kind it's very highrisk high reward so be careful with that it does have pretty poor range compared to level two so if you're like trying to go through fireballs and stuff probably level two is your best bet and of course we have to talk about raging demon so you actually don't see raging demon that often looking at very high level Kuma matches and that's because honestly most people just prefer to combo into it because comboing in the super is just so strong in this game and you can cancel into raging demon and it does actually do a little bit extra damage anytime you cancel into a special instead of canceling into Tatu or whatever cancel into cor CLE back light punch do the followup and then you can do demon after this and it's honestly not too hard you can just like keep mashing light punch like I do there then hit forward play Kick and heavy punch but this actually does do slightly more damage than canceling into level three if you want to do it as a command grab it does work the thing I recommend doing is doing like a drive rush now if you're really sweaty you can do Drive rush into demon I can't do it I think it's a really hard input but if you play on like hit boox or something might be doable a lot easier version is you can just do Drive rush to jab and then do the demon and as you can see I'm holding up but you can't actually uh jump it and this is UN Mashable it's really good uh but I find often like I just don't get the opportunity to land it honestly so four me punches is overhead uh you can do Drive Rush overhead that's the main time you're doing it just so you can be able to combo off of it if they're hit crouching I think the best confirm you can do is this double medium punch Target combo that he has I don't find this used very often usually like newer akumas use this as like a combo filler because it looks good but it's it scales your combo to [ __ ] so realistically you don't really want to do it that much the only place I know it's optimal is on a crouching opponent here uh it does a little bit more damage than stand medium kick which is what most people do I recommend doing stand medium kick just because it's easier and uh it works on standing as well this funny enough does not work on standing it like pushes them too far back honestly just don't use this that often Crouch light kick I technically didn't talk about but um basically you just use it to catch walk back crou medium kick most of the time you're using because it has longer range but let's say on knockdown you can do the Double Dash setup they're always walking back you know you can kind of just rinse and repeat this sequence as well with Crouch leg kick I'm not sure if I talked much about stand heavy kick but this normal uh is is every beginner akuma's best friend uh but you really have to be careful because if they are blocking and they Crouch it you just die if you want to get good with Akuma you really should not spam this I'm I'm going keep it a buck the good akumas use forward heavy punch the bad kumas just use this and pray the opponent doesn't know how to punish it this does still have some use though you know there's there are some combos that this is uh optimal like after di so for example after the this combo is optimal here if you want to keep it meterless the only other time I would recommend doing this is as a whiff punish so if you're really clean with the whiff punish you can use stand heavy kick but of course course it is risky You could argue like yeah on standing it's pretty good it's Plus on block but if there's just standing then use Crouch medium kick I don't think I talked about this move at all either medium kick Tatu it can be used to go through Fireballs but it's really hard there I got it I only did 600 damage you have to have really crack reactions to do it the other time I see this is you know anytime you do light kick tots you can also do medium kick Tatu right it does less damage than light Ki Tatu there's some really specific combos that use MK Tatu let's just put it like that um I don't think you I think pretty much anytime you have the ability to use l kick Tatu you should use l kick Tatu all right so after L kick toasu instead of doing the sweep you can just go straight into demon flip I like the heavy kick version and then you can kind of like do a little cross up if they don't uh Tech or you can you know empty jump throw empty jump Block it's not that much better than you know just run up stand medium punch and if they back teack it's really hard to cross up so I don't like it but I I think a lot of akumas feel like this demon flip mixup is like the future of the character so maybe there's some potential there also some Twitter tech for you guys I think are is really useful that I think eventually you'll want to learn um this is a there's a lot more optimal combos right so for example this is a much more optimal version of the version that we went through but obviously uses a lot more Drive gauge so unless you're like a Akuma Master don't bother with these combos right away this is the most damage optimal combo that I found almost does 7K damage you see that it uses the uh ex PA Burns you out and funny enough that doesn't even use demon even though demon does more damage you can't actually get airborne juggle on demon here this is a example of medium kiasu I actually find myself in this situation quite a bit um right I did the version with heavy kick Tatu this combo is like actually kind of hard but it is definitely more optimal if you want to go this route as well anyways that's it for Akuma if this guy was helpful or you want to see more Street Fire guides consider like Shar subscribing on the video really helps us out and helps us put out more content like this Akuma is considered to be really strong right now as the recording is guide and if previous Street Fighters were anything to judge he's always going to be strong so I think he's a good investment character there's a ton of different ways to play him so there's a lot of different akuma's out there there's freaking Dao at the top of the leaderboards just doing stand heavy punch Fireball Fireball Fireball uh walk up throw right you can play your Akuma really really basic or you know you can learn some of the tech that we talked about with demon Flip or you know go really heavy on air Fireball Etc leave any comments below if there's additional things that you think should be in the guide or anything that you learned you want to shout out and you think would be helpful for other new players picking up the character as always take care of y'all and peace
