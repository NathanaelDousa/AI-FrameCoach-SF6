season 3 ryu is a different beast buff fireballs faster supers and new combo routes that melt health bars let me show you what he's really capable of now so in this video we're breaking down new routes tricky setups and big damage combos [Music] since ryu has a rail gun when his dungeon is charged his level one super now connects from midscreen after doing an od tatsu before season 3 there wasn't really a reason to go for an od tatu since it didn't lead to anything [Music] [Music] if you got some drive meter to spare and land a sequence in the corner you can side switch with an od donkey kick just make sure to input the dp motion toward the direction you're dashing the game will auto correct and give you the proper side if you catch your opponent with this hashi gekki frame trap off of crouching light punch drive rush in with the crouching medium punch and cancel into od donkey kick then dash forward input the dp motion in the direction you're dashing and quickly follow up with the level three input in the opposite direction but if you start the hashi frame trap with a standing light punch you'll need to use the standing heavy punch instead if you go for the crashing medium punch the opponent will be too high and it'll whiff level two got a solid buff when dungeon is stocked stage two charges faster now and you can link into it from normals like standing heavy punch this dungeon power stage two puts the opponent into a rolling juggle state giving you big damage potential if you're ready to spend all of your resources when juggling with drive rush crouching heavy punch you'll need to slightly delay each hit to keep the opponent from rising too high this version of the combo uses a manual drive rush instead of a button cancel it nets you a bit more damage and some style points if you pull it off in a match if you got the resources you can tack on a level one after the heavy donkey kick an opening is everything i have an opening everything i have this is ryu's highest damage punish counter combo in the corner if you're fully stocked on resources it's especially brutal against characters like akuma with 9,000 health this sequence can wipe out nearly 90% of their life bar if you end with a level one is it practical probably not can it happen absolutely you everything i have with everything i have so remember how i said ryu has a rail gun now with dungeon stocked his level one got its speed doubled it's basically a laser beam he can now punish characters during projectile wars or even midan animation for example eclipse jamie while he's drinking jp while he's snapping ken during od fireball to drive rush the works this safe jump setup isn't new it's been around for a while but i don't think i've shown it in any of my previous videos if you get a juggle from heavy hasho you can drive rush into back heavy kick then cancel into light hasho for a clean safe jump have you ever ended the od donkey kick too close to the corner yep me too but now with the faster level one especially with dungeon stocked you can actually catch them with it after they fly over your head with the universal changes to crouching light kicks you're now plus enough to frame trap if your opponent presses a button after drive rush crouching light kick following up with the crouching medium punch is a common option it's easy to hit confirm and reliably traps four-frame lights there are plenty of variations on his sequence but i wanted to show you this one to give you a starting point for ideas building on the crouching light kick buff you can also go into back heavy punch and even if it trades with a four-frame button your opponent stays in hit stun long enough to link to another move and keep the combo going in this sequence i'm using crouch and medium punch or a crouch and medium kick but you can extend it with a standing heavy punch for more damage the only downside to this route is that the back heavy punch can be tough to hit confirm whether it trades gets blocked or lands clean if it's blocked and you don't cancel you're left negative and open for them to punish right there right there i'll kill you right there capcom went a little wild with this they even buffed ryu's fireballs they do more damage now and with the level one punish you can link into big buttons off of a punish counter fireball from there you can go with the classic combo route or get creative with a dungeon charge level two in this setup i'm using medium tatsu into meaty fireball in the corner to beat out wake up level one here's a few examples of what you can follow up with after a punish counter fireball it's easy to hit confirm and even if your opponent just blocks instead of waking up with level one you're still plus use the right sequence for the situation whether you're looking to close out a round or chip away at the drive meter an opening right there last but not least if you go for a crashing medium kick into dry brush to jab tick throw and your opponent jumps away you can actually catch them on the way down with level one thanks to the speed buff it's reactable but you got to be locked in and ready there's probably an option select for this that i haven't figured out yet but at least now you know it's a legit punish to go for that's it for season 3 ryu tech new combos setups and all the ways he's cooking now try out some of these let me know what you come up with and i'll catch you in the next one gg's and i'll see you later peace
