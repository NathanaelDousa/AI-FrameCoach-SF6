all right what's up guys we're back with another one here today I want to give you a little guide with a character I've been playing for about 10 hours now having a lot of fun someone I didn't expect but Lily this character is so easy yet so strong so I think she's a great choice for for new players I want to give you a real basic but really effective game plan to play with her and the good thing is this works up with classic and modern okay so whatever input style this does work it's effective anyway let's get right to it if you like this like stupid hit the sub button let me know you want to see next so Lily what what kind of character is he or is she you know is she like Speedy is she like a Grappler she's she's a gorilla surprisingly she's a girl I was shocked when I fought her so I'm not gonna go over every button actually I want to tell you as a new player ignore all of her buttons you don't need to worry about any button except one that is this if you're playing on Classic this is the fierce button if you're playing on Modern this is just like the heavy attack but so not only is this button whether it's the Ford one the back one or the down one not only is the range so good but for some reason it's special cancer I don't know why but you can cancel these into specials which is insane for the the type of move this is so her game plan press this button a lot all right press this button a lot and then cancel it into this the Back special whatever whatever the input is it's the same the same game plan right you want to use the medium version here so on Block it's safe and or relatively safe and on hit it combos right here but more importantly whenever you do this you see that little three bar at the top you're building up a wind stop so while you're attacking you're building the wind stock and that's where her game really opens up all right so I got the wind socks powered up from attacking you've done a little bit of damage but now you're scary because it is this I can't believe this so the same game plan right you still flown away with this but instead of going for this move you want to go for this move now you see that little thing right there says advantage 1f that means you are one frame positive that means you have the advantage which means it's still your turn so you're basically skipping footsies it's your turn now you're right in front of them you have the advantage so what does that mean if they press a button right if they try to jab let's say they have like a jab or something you can command grab right if they block if they think you're gonna attack you got a command grab if they jab or press a slow button you command grab it beats them right there okay now if they want to try jumping or something that's when you wanna this is a base called a strike though mix up but if they want to try jumping after that you want to just use your fastest button which is the light attack or uh if you're on classic the short attack that's it and then the game plan repeats right you just keep pressuring you build up the win stocks when you have them you get in just murder them I'm Not Gonna Keep too many combos this is the combo you need that one this is another really important combo to get after you have the win stocks ready it has to be powered up right so it's all right you expire exdp and then you can DP down if you want as well it's that simple it's that simple anything else you need to know this character uh anti-air DP you know DP on Modern just one button the command grab is a good mix-up tool on its own even out of there and I think that's it I'm gonna show you don't we're gonna play some matches right after this but that's it I just taught you how to play this character so if you don't believe me let's play some matches I'll break it down for you as I'm doing it you're gonna see me doing exactly what I just showed you right now from China I might turn this one down though because this might be laggy ah it seems okay I look at we got a mirror match to play all right let's go so I'm gonna show you right Hammer Time Hammer times I got three stocks now it's time to switch up the game plan I don't know what he's doing but okay all right ready I'm in here there we go see I did the the short that time I still have a stock I'm in it's still my turn right I ran out of stocks now so I'm gonna go back to swinging I'm gonna go back to swinging also I forgot to mention you can just build up a stock on its own if you do the light version YOLO yo on Plus and be ready with that but as you see it's Focus like I'm pressing one what I'm pressing one button build up the stocks and then you go in I gotta stop I got two stocks okay okay so you are weak to drive impact but that's like everything in this game so if you think a driving Pack's coming just press h press the fierce button and don't cancel it so just press the fierce button wait for the drive impact and do it back I could have ended with super right there I'm not joking did you just I pressed one one I pressed one button it's that good I got two stocks now so I'm going in now three hits sorry buddy I'm going in again combo oops sorry I didn't have a stock I forgot to mention too for that corner combo you need a stock extra that's why it's always good to have build multiple instead of just one and I got three don't jump don't jump don't jump try to go in oh let's go in there I'll just kick him instead I'll just kick him instead wait all right so I my bad I gotta play footsies right so now I don't have any stocks I'm thinking about how can I how can I get them up how can I get up you just won't let me charge all right nice jump that's plus and there we go I see even he can do it it's so even if I know it's coming I'm telling you it's that effective it's not like oh this is either this is day Zero stuff it's not gonna work it's a legit mixer it's legit very very strong it's like the core of our game plan she forces you to get in this mix-up situation I think he's gonna jump but I'll go for a command grab here no he went for a grab I don't know what he's doing oh whoa what are you doing level three that combo I showed you earlier too the one button into the twirl you can cancel that in level three so if you're looking at cash out this boy got them stocks uh oh so it's not gonna I'm gonna just run out some time but I'm in a bad spot actually I'm gonna run are you getting Spivey spiers on toes all right I got it back nice yeah whoa bro Plus hey I win I win I win I win I win I got another game I just press one button I play one more play one more you through there you go be able to react though so you have to do it again I got three stocks here we go I'm going in command grab he reversaled out Boop s all right I got three stocks no we traded I could have condespired in I would have been plus and not gonna go for a mix-up now let's see stocks stocks stocks we both got three stocks on Plus I'm plus combo [Music] neutral jump neutral jump again whoa bro he's gonna drive impact soon I think so I'm Not Gonna Cancel well he's gonna do this instead Payback I didn't do that but just to show you that's the combo that was that was a mistake I did not mean to do that all right I got one win stock I got two I still got two it's okay foreign Plus I messed up the combo you see I was plus after that I'm plus I'm in Bonk Bonk I forgot to mention just mashing on Heavies does a lot of Drive damage too so like you burn out people a lot with the character I'm super plus ready um Plus command grab good game it's easy trust me all right let's go back I gotta show you one other thing that's really important too all right you saw it that's it I'm I'm not joking I'm not trying to be funny you see just Mash on this mess either one's good stand Fierce back Fierce down fears all of them are canceled there's one thing that's really really important too again zoning characters so this move will not go through if they're throwing Fireballs it's hard to get in but you gotta make sure you have a stock right so if you got stocks up let's try again so we sweep them the ex buyer from any range goes right through like that very very very very powerful very very powerful so like against zoning characters if you can get a stock in uvx they can't throw Fireball they have to be very very careful because like I showed earlier right EX you don't got to spend it all to burn out but like you can steal around like that that's another very very important thing that's it for a beginner guide that is going to get you so far so what am I now I'm I'm Platinum like I'm gonna get to Diamond there's no doubt I'm gonna get the diamond just playing like this before you really unlock her other stuff like she does have other like cooler Mix-Ups you got some setups but you don't need that that's at the highest highest highest level this basic game plan is all you need and that's it I'm done I don't wanna I don't want to talk too long I don't make the video too long but this guide should help you and like I said earlier uh everything I showed Works in both classic and modern so whatever your controller type is uh you can just copy what I did it's she plays herself dude she plays herself she plays herself yeah that's it hopefully it helps you out hopefully you're fun this character is very very fun she's very enjoyable so if there's anybody else you want to see let me know I can do these simple guys they're not they're not too time consuming but yeah uh hit the sub button hope you enjoyed see you next one peace thank you [Music] foreign [Music]
