hey guys it's Rush Hopewell doing well welcome back to the channel this video today is more of a like a knowledge dump in terms of just Street Fighter 6 can my Approach and what I've learned recently so what has happened recently is I've been playing daily whether it's been long set short sets long rank sessions short rank sessions I've tried to get games in every day consistently and the reason for this is I wanted to build more muscle memory more awareness more familiarity when it comes to Street Fighter 6. I really felt at the beginning like I didn't understand the game and it didn't feel quite right to me I wasn't very familiar with the way the game is played and how it felt but me playing it every day has helped with that process and admittedly it's something I chose not to do at the beginning I chose to focus on content more than playing the game but I've done that for a few weeks now playing the game and it's been really useful it's been challenging I've learned a lot for the process and I feel much more comfortable with the game itself now you could ask do I like the game I'm not too sure if I like love the game but I'm starting to enjoy it a lot more than I was before so it gives you some context regarding where this video comes from so let's go into a few things in terms of tips and approaches with Ken that may help you in your gameplay so in terms of news from my Approach in this game is to throw Fireballs at this sort of range you can mix up different strengths you know no risk of jumpings or a raw driving packed at this range but at this sort of range there are mainly three buttons I'm using here and the three buttons are crouching meeting kick Stan heavy punch and I will use stand meeting kick as well now this is risky because if the opponent does a DI whether to read or just random it will destroy this move you know if you're in startup you can't do anything you can't block the DI and the only follow-up you get from Stan meeting kick is the rest of the target combo so those are the buttons that I'm using and what I'm trying to do is is I'm using the stand heavy punch as a hit confirm it's fully hit confirmable there's a huge confirmation window and I'm confirming into specials now I am a fan of not spending Drive um where I don't have to so drivers cancels because it does cost you three bars you can do things like stand heavy punch into DP you can even confirm it into the run and then DP as well so these are good ways to get damage without spending Drive I do try to focus more on spending as little drive as possible so these are the sort of things I'm doing with that heavy punch you can go into drive Rush of course get big conversions and call and carry sand medium kick it is just a button to throw out and confirm I mean it's it's good because it's eight frame startup and it's got a lot of reach that's why it's a good button but I mentioned the disadvantages of it what I do like about this button is I do like converting into other buttons rather than the tie combo only on County and punish counter you can see there you get stand low kick and counter hit and if you're in range you can get crash meaning kick it does combo that I don't do as much but that's really nice on punish counter the Crouch meaning kick I try not to just commit to Driver's cancel I do try to find like a wish punish with cracked meaning kick it's really really good because you get Corner carry from this and it does protect you from people doing di if someone does Di in neutral and you do catch me kick into drive Rush as shown before you can fully react with your own di in that situation but this is always good because of the corner carry not so much the damage I mentioned Fireballs so with the Fireballs what I am doing is I'm throwing different speeds of fireballs at this range and what you can do is is you can follow the fireball up much like a Street Fighter 5 with a run so you throw your Fireball and you can run behind it now this creates somewhat of a mix because you can do the run and just cancel it into uh like Ken's kick his step kick can do that to create pressure and I use this a lot more now so it's a mix-up I may throw a fireball run run stuff and just wait that could bite them into jumping forward so I can DP um you could throw fireballs and if you know they throw a fireball if you've already committed to run you can fully react to them throwing a fireball and you can actually run DP it is tricky it is a timing thing it's not something you can really plan for it's more about recognizing that you've done a run whilst I've done a projectile you can do that I've done it a few times but I do like this technique of throwing a slow Fireball and following up with the step kick you can get in trouble if you do this if they do a jump and you're already in the mindset of doing the step kick the kick itself you will be punishable so there is risk to this but this is a really nice technique another example of using this would be after level one level two super you can set up a fireball here and do the run after it and this is a common place where people will jump they'll try and jump forward over the Fireball and that run you do after the fireball you can react to their jump and just do a run DP to antia it's really nice with doing firewall into step kick one of the cool things about the step kick is if it's counter here you can link this into stand light kick even at quite some range so having your conversions down off the counter step kick is super important another option from the run is to run into overhead running to overhead is really good because it's -3 on block so it is completely safe and if you do catch your opponent crouching you will connect with the overhead that'd be plus three combining run overhead with level 3 super you can confirm this on hit into level 3 super but it's also worth noting if you hit counter hit overhead you are plus five so you can go into stand light kick with closer range you can go into stand medium punch another good technique to using new Choice Ken's OD Fireball especially where it collides with somebody else's firewall so what happens in this game is is rather than the fireball nullifying one hit of my two hit projectile you can see ryu's getting hit for two hits my Audi Fireball is not only beating reuse Fireball but both hits are going through what you can do behind this is you can drive Rush and get conversions something else I do a little bit when it comes to neutral is I will test people with button into medium kitchen right it's that sequence there this will naturally combo into the low follow-up uh it doesn't go into the combo into the overhead but the overhead does a reset it is like a frame trap I guess quite a large gap between the media gym right into the overhead but I do use this sometimes to see what the opponent does and to put in their mind about you know holding Parry or doing drive impact one cool thing about doing this is if you land a hit so if it's that heavy punch into medium gym right crash a mini kick intermediate kitchen right if you recognize the hit you can confirm this into level three obviously that's going to do massive damage and as you guys already know the mini kitchen right into low follow-up it does frame track four frame buttons so you can convert from that with stand light kick into some form of follow-up when it comes to punish counter whether it be a Punisher on a special move or just a rogue punish counter the combo Roots I go for again I try and focus on not spending too much Drive bar through driver's cancel so for example the Crouch heavy punch punish character punish I would go for something like uh like this so a route like this does over 3000 damage and it costs Zero Bar now these are combos people don't use that much because they are more focused on the corner carry which I understand but if you want damage look into these roots corner you definitely want to be using the Run Run Stop chin Buster into run tattoo not as much damage but it's the corner carry you want the corner carry for the corner control so that's probably one of his best routes it's also powerful because of the old key you get for it which we'll talk about shortly sand heavy can punish counter there's a few things you can do here which are quite nice so you don't have to spend drive and if you don't spend drive you can do raw run into into the Run DP that's really nice there's decent damage if you're at close range and you want damage without spending drive you can do run Dragon Mash now I don't see people using this enough but this is really good when you combine with super because you're getting good damage but again you're not spending any drive so it's quite a powerful technique to use and obviously stand heavy kick punish counter with drive you want to do um Drive rushing to stand heavy punch then run into run follow-up I'm a big fan of doing stand heavy punch run DP the reason for this is sometimes if you do Drive rushed and heavy punch run into the tattoo the tattoo could sometimes hit like in a janky way and put yourself in the corner it's happened to me far too many times now so I stick to the Run DP in that situation when it comes to drive impact punish counter I am using the neutral drum punish Roots a lot more again because I'm saving Drive bar and I'm doing a lot of damage through these routes I still will spend meter on OD where I feel it needs to be done I like this route for example with the old attacks at the end because it puts the opponent directly into the corner you can see if I go for this route whilst it's a bit more damage I don't quite have as good Corner positioning routes like this are also good as well but why I'm not that fond of this route is because it takes the opponent out of the corner so sparkle about run tattoo and old key this is really important because probably one of the best okay situations for Ken and you get obviously the corner carry as well but you need to learn Ken's Run Run Stop sequences here so this is the knockdown and I am Plus 43 in this situation to get the old key mix here what you do is if you whiff sand Jab into run run stop from here you can set up a throne or you can set up below string but what makes this ultimix even more powerful is that situation so if you do whiff jab into run overhead rather than run stop you can hit a meaty overhead which links into Crag jab into chin Buster that's really powerful for people that are Crouch [ __ ] after that situation you can also bait DP with this ulti sequence one of Ken's nastiest mixes in the corner is using chinbuster or punch Target combo into heavy kick gym right when you do this heavy whiffs but what you do is you delay the overhead follow-up once you have the timing down you can get the overhead follow-up to hit meaty if you get it meaty it'll be plus five so it will link into stand meeting Punch or even crowd sharp stand meeting punch something else that is very strong on old key is where you want to bait throws in this game you can do a backlash as the opponent gets off the ground to bait throws you will be at risk of some wake up supers in this situation so I don't recommend it but it's good to know you can do this otherwise you can just stand back outside of throw range to make throw with and block the DP or super thank you lastly I wanted to talk about some key combo routes that I use one level three route that I use this will be if I do a full drive Rush cancel spin to finish a round or even just off a regular punish counter or into level three I do like to use Crouch meaning punch into medium kitchen right heavy gym right level three the reason I end my combo route with this is because of the damage mid screen it's the most damage you'd get from a level 3 scenario bring in the heat in terms of gym running the corner I keep it super simple these days for a Juggle situation I will usually go for the meeting kit gym Rai heavy kick follow-up scenario if you want to spend bar I go to the oldie gym my roots foreign I'd always end my combos now with the grounded gym right scenario reason being it is more optimal damage specifically where you end your combos especially that route there where you do heavy gym right low follow-up grounded situation into Lightroom right heavy kick follow-up canceling to level three it's the most optimal damage for level 3 in the corner so yeah whole Flex helped give more insight into how to play the character and how to simplify the approach that's all I really do with this character I don't break out anymore from what I've just mentioned this video any questions any queries as always give me a shout and I'll catch you in the next one take care
