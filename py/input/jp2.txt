hello and welcome this is dark synth and I'll
be bringing you the only JP guide that you need for Street Fighter 6. grab your snacks and your anime body pillows
because JP is one nutty character starting off with JP's game plan he aims to keep you
full screen and shoot projectiles at you constantly making you not able to move and just not have
fun with moves ranging from instant ground spikes to low and overhead Shadow clones this
character is bound to make people upset and cry down down plus punch is JP's psycho Spike
that he summons from the ground this is a very fast move and each strength correlates
to the distance that it goes light punch is close medium punch is half screen and heavy
punch is full screen of course this can be enhanced by pressing two punch buttons light
plus medium will give you a close range ex Spike heavy plus medium will give you a full
screen ex Spike light plus heavy will give you a half screen ex Spike quarter Circle
back plus punch will make JP summon a sky Tire just like a spike summon each strength
correlates to the distance that he summons it at light is close medium is half screen
and depending on the Range heavy can make it behind your opponent this move has multiple
properties if you just let it sit there it'll eventually break with a spike bursting out
of it however there are more options off this move if JP ink puts quarter Circle back punch
either medium or light this will teleport him through the rift with light and medium
teleporting him different distances inputting quarter Circle back plus heavy punch while
the rift is out will make it instantly explode with a spike the EX version is much similar
to the psycho Spike light plus medium will summon two portals close to JP heavy plus
medium will summon two portals far away and light plus heavy will summon two portals mid-screen
the EX version acts the same as the regular however there are now two portals out on screen
the opponent now has two portals to worry about which is two tears breaking as well
as JP being able to teleport out of one of them with two portals out performing quarter
Circle back plus light punch will teleport JP to the closest tear to him quarter Circle
back plus medium punch will teleport him to the furthest Portal from him and quarter Circle
back plus heavy punch will make both tears burst quarter Circle Ford plus light kick
medium kick or heavy kick all summons a different sort of Shadow light kick summons a mid-shadow
medium kick summons a overhead Shadow and heavy kick summons a low hitting Shadow combining
these with having riffs in the air is very scary the EX version will send out a shadow
swiping at the opponent twice these will be one of JP's best zoning tools next to his
Spike summon down down plus Kicks Will Allow JP to do a Parry this move is very strong
as it's frame 1 and the EX version can Parry level 3 supers and command grabs before [Laughter] depending on how much recovery
the move has when parrying with this move will allow JP to follow up and punish them
with a combo quarter Circle back plus kick will make JP
summon a full stream command grab yeah that's right a full screen command grab this is mainly
used once JP is able to condition his opponent to not move if your opponent tries to read
your projectiles with a drive Perry you can just do ex command and grab and make him eat
a chunk of damage now when JP's notable normals standing medium
punch is a great poke however it's very slow on recovery and if your opponent happens to
drive impact while in the middle of it you will eat the drive impact it has great range
however this is not special cancelable crouching medium punch is a great close range poke tool
as it is special cancelable and drive Rush cancelable standing medium kick is an okay
button however it is special cancelable and can go into dry brush crushing medium kick
is a great poke tool to keep your opponent from walking in or trying to catch them walk
back standing heavy punch is a great whiff Punisher tool as well as a good pressure tool
if you happen to poke them with a standing heavy punch and they block it you can go into
an ex Shadow or ground Spike pressure sequences will get to in a bit standing heavy kick is
a great poke as its plus two on block and allows JP to frame trap with a Crouch light
punch this can also go into a Target combo with standing heavy punch afterwards crouching
heavy punches JP's anti-air it's also good in combos again I'll go over that later at
a range Stan handy kit can be a great anterior tool however don't use this if they're close
by trying to cross you up back medium punch is a fairly decent fast
normal as well as it going into another medium punch for it being a Target combo this can
be dry brush canceled and special canceled Ford plus medium kick is JP's overhead he
doesn't get anything off this unless he's in dry brush playing neutral with JP involves trying to
knock your opponent down either with a poke and a quarter Circle forward punches or knocking
them back with a shadow clone this is your opportunity to set up a tear in the sky and
start zoning your opponent with more Shadow clones and ground spikes well that's it for the basic JP part now here's
some Combos and at the end of the video I'll have a match so you can have a good idea on
