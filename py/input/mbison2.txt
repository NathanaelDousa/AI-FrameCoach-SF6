my pitch for why you should play mbison he's simple to pick up with excellent space control he can fly high in the air with shadows rise he can go through Fireballs with psycho Crusher and he has one of the best forward advancing specials in the game with scissor kicks on offense he can place a bomb that detonates after a few seconds leading to lots of strong offensive sequences and he also has a horse Ros anante however the downside is he has some of the weakest defense in the game no ex reversal and his super reversals are all slow and of this recording I'm in the top 10 bison in North America so you know you'll be in good hands with this guy let's do this all right so the first thing I want to start with is bison's neutral game bison has several really strong tools to work with a neutral Shadows rise and the different follow-ups scissor kicks and psycho Crusher and some of his normals so we'll start with the most obvious one which is scissor kicks now this is the move that everyone on Twitter thinks is really really strong and it is now the three versions they all go different spacing uh heavy kick it goes the furthest and the goal with this move is you want to space it so basically the end of his foot is hitting him so you don't want this to happen because if you miss space this for example they just kill you right you have to be kind of careful spacing this but thankfully like you can still like overshoot this un Block it's generally really safe as long as you space it properly so there it was spaced properly and they wouldn't be able to punish so for example like uh I can't reach at these spacings and if I do something slower it's just not a punish like that wasn't actually a punish right do have to be really careful because if they are up close they get a punish and if they're on point this punish is going to go into a decent amount of damage although only lights can punish this move uh light and medium scissor kick are minus 5 the heavy scissor kicks only minus 4 so you need to know if you're playing bison that you know what four frame and five frame normal go the furthest to reach bison now there's a bunch of reasons why you throw this out one it's unreactable they're just like walking around in this range you know half the time that means they're not blocking which means you could kind of throw it out randomly and it might hit them and then on hit you actually have a pretty good situation where you can either go for a throw uh depending on the distance right so like let's say I'm here you go for a throw um you can go for you know walk back try to bait like a DP um a really common option is walk back heavy punch just in case they happen to throw Tech or you can try to just attack so Crouch light stand light's really common depending on the spacing and then like I used to call this the infinite because you can just kind of loop this over against worst players right the other advantage of this move is that on counter hit and punish counter you actually get a combo so on counter hit your combo looks something like this where you get the combo into a light and I like to go into the bomb here uh but you can also just go into scissor kicks like this uh stand light is generally more consistent so I recommend doing that and then you get the bomb and then they eventually explodes and then you know you get mixed up right so I recommend going into the bomb because I think the the post bomb situation is better but you can just go into scissors kick cuz it's it's easier right and on punish counter you get Crouch medum punch right so this Crouch medum punch can go into anything but I recommend ex scissor kicks and we'll talk about that more later now there's a bunch of different ways people will deal with scissor kicks so di seems like it' be really good at first glance but they actually have to do it preemptively you can't actually react to scissor kicks right so if I tried to react that was 16 frames no one can react faster than 16 frames right and even the heavy version of scissor kicks you have to react in 21 frames so if they can block the DI that means they can also di back so if someone is di eying your scissor kicks that means you're being way too predictable just wait a little bit and then di them back the other really common option is people just neutral jump like crazy so the idea is that if you happen to scissor kick the scissor kick whiffs and you get punched now there's a few different ways you can deal with the the neutral jumps one is you just do you wait for them to land and then do scissor kicks uh this is probably the easiest thing to do right cuz if they happen to like like jump or they happen to press a button you're going to be able to C them the second thing is if you have a really good read you can do Drive Rush Crouch heavy punch and so you you can do something like level two and you can just blow them up for trying to neutral jump so realistically neutral Jump's not that good of a strategy unless they do like very sparingly and they have a good read on their scissor kick now what I think the best thing to do against scissor kick is just walk and block right like it's really important to know the range where it's punishable and where it's not right if you're blocking scissor kick and you can't punish or what will happen is that like if opponent's good they won't try to like mistakenly punish the scissor kick and so they'll start poking out like this right if you're the other bison you you just you just block right the other thing they might do is like they might try to like take their turn with something really slow you can also block that too or you could try to counter pooke you could try to do something like this Crouch Med and punch after they catch like a whiff button if I do stand heavy punch as a Defender I'm going get clipped right so this this kind of like rock paper scissors game that happens after a block scissor kick that's honestly probably in your favor because you're the one initiating it and you're going to be more ready for this rock paper scissors game the other really common situation is that they'll try to punish and they miss their punish and so what's really good I think with bison is you do space scissor kicks and then you press five heavy punch I'm either forced to block right and that that's a plus on block or I try to like take my turn with something slower and I get punished countered and then I die so there's a lot of application to this move but if I can summarize the section it's throw out scissor kicks when you think they're going to get hit by it and even if they block like just try to rotate your options you know sometimes press after sometimes just walk back and also if they're just blocking the whole time you're you're slowly shipping away at their Drive gauge right and just pushes them to the corner so they're just blocking like you're already winning the game all right the second really strong move with bison is this Shadows rise uh there's two different follow-ups there's the doubl reverse followup which is really really strong the cool thing about this is you can kind of angle it you can angle it back you can kind of Ang angle it neutral you can angle it forward and if they happen to block it uh it's your turn um the most common thing I'll do is I'll do this and I'll go for a throw or I'll like neutral jump and like try to bait the throw right you have the head stomp fall the head stomp fall up is okay it's really good against people like trying to DP because they'll just like make the DP whiff and then they die um this actually isn't that great on block though I recommendation is just use just air to air jump back and if they happen to like do some like you know Shenanigans like this which you can do a followup after the stomp you'll just just hit them and then they take a lot of damage the safest thing to do after this is just back off and see what they do and if they if they're sitting still and they're not doing anything then you can uh just come down press punch come down and then you know you get a strike throw mixup again uh the one tip i' give for this move is if you're going to commit to the punch just commit right away because like often times like people will wait too long and then this will just the the punch fall up will just whiff so you can literally just like mash it out and the punch follow up will come out at the right time but yeah how recommend uh doing Devils reverse is three main things you want to rotate between right the heavy kick version goes the furest so you can you know just go for Stomp and try to like preempt something you can do immediate Devil's reverse and I'll often times like stop air to air or you can just do Shadows rise and to nothing and then see what they do right and these are all really hard to stop right so if I tried to go air to air uh I'm just going to get clipped right if I'm waiting for this to come down I press Crouch heavy Punch Yeah that's not not good right I'm waiting for them to come down I press couch heavy punch I get punched I die so there's a there's a very strong RPS game here that's um pretty much in your favor the only disadvantage is it's charge so it's pretty obvious like when they're going to go for it and if they're really on point and or if you do it the right spacing this air to air will like blow you up right especially character like bison with one of the best air to airs in the game uh you're going to be hurting but make sure you rotate your options and you should be able to get doubles of R working on people as long as you're do it from like this range here if you do it from really close air to air becomes a lot better DP becomes a lot better you kind of have to catch them off guard or like use it to for example like escape the corner and you stomp on their head and like try try to get away and the third option that's really strong in neutral psycho Crusher you don't really use the light medium heavy version that much to neutral they can go through Fireballs they technically can antire actually the light's quite good at anti it's also like really good to deal with like stuff like head stomp right so it's like you can kind of either get away or if like you predict it right then you know you can antire so light csy Crush are good for antire psycho Crushers are more for combos Ex Psycho Crusher where it's at though this move is cracked one it's sea block so if they block it you can't be punished it's also not even in throw range so if they want to throw you if they have to take a risk and walk forward which means that you can Mash after it so the RPS isn't even that bad the main advantage is it goes through Fireballs if you're you're like at this range you can just react with v cyer Crusher and punish their Fireball and then at you know just Dash forward and then they get mixed up right so you can start your whole offensive game plan off one ex psychic Crusher it's also quite fast if if you're just like looking to clip someone like walking forward in this range like you hit them and then and then you go forward so to me this is his best EX move by far it's also really good in Burnout because in Burnout it's plus one so for example they're in Burnout and you just do this now it's your turn right you can do stuff like this uh that's like really really strong if they're ever in Burnout not to mention the amount of Chip it does a lot of trouble doing his charge attack can you explain how to do psychic Crusher yeah so the way charge moves work in this game uh they're both the same for psycho Crusher and shadows rise is you have to hold back for psycho Crusher down for Devil's reverse for 50 frames so you see this counter on the left so as long as that counter hits 40 so you see I didn't get a pych Crusher there because I only held back for 39 frames now as long as that counter hits at least 40 and then you hit forward you'll get the psycho Crusher or you'll get the um Devil's rise right you just need to make sure you you know you time it well enough that you're you're at least hitting 40 and most people they don't do it exactly 40 they usually wait like a second so that way they know for sure they're getting the charge input instead of getting something like something like this right uh he has some other tools that are pretty good for controlling space particularly stand medium kick this move is quite good it's fast has really good range uh it's good just to kind of throw out if you need something like you're not sure what the opponent's going to do you just want to control some space you can walk forward stand medium kick them and you know see what happens right St jab also has a pretty decent amount of range so if you're ever like you not sure what to do you need something quick to throw out uh St jab kind of serves that purpose his Drive Rush is insanely good as well so uh yeah as you can see he goes really far I think the best options after Drive Rush are probably crash light kick crash light kick combos in the crash M kick into you know ex or whatever you want after that drive Rush sand medium punch is pretty good we can talk about that later but it gives you a lot of advantage on hit and block all right so some other tools uh down forward heavy kick is like a slide I actually don't think it's that great in terms of risk reward like if if they block it you die if you get a hit you only get like 900 damage right so use this move they're like never down backing you know it's going to hit but use it very sparingly the other neutral move I recommend is Crouch medum punch this is like a very good buffer which means that like so for example if they're ever like dashing forward or they're like whiffing something uh you can just kind of like throw it out into ex scissor kicks or you know Drive Rush cancel uh and it's really good stopping it just because it's really fast and has a good hit box right the other place is really good is like you know the opponent's Drive rushing at you this is your best Drive Rush check and then again you get pretty good damage off this uh Drive Rush counter crash me kick also really really strong uh it's not something you just kind of throw out but it's more of like you walk forward and just try to catch them walking back again your forward walk speeds faster than people's back walk speed so if you get the read They're going to be walking back right you can kind of like clip their walk back with a Crouch medum kick and then you can go into a combo right bison has two an tires jump medium punch and Crouch heavy punch right Crouch heavy punch it's a little easier to use but sometimes it trades uh unless you do it really early the nice thing is you get a knockdown right so a lot of antire normals you don't get a knockdown this time you can always drive rush and after them get a mixup but the trade-off is you have to press it a little bit earlier than some other an ties the antire that makes him really good an tiing is this jump medium punch and the cool thing is you can get a juggle the easiest thing just do medium psycho Crusher if you want to be optimal Drive Rush after this into to Target combo and to L bomb all right so let's talk section two let's talk about combos now a lot of characters their General usage of meter is I'm going use a lot of Drive meter to kind of cash out and do Drive Rush cancel right now bison is a little bit different he has a very very good ex move for combo which is ex scissor kick right now this ex scissor kick has a lot of different follow-ups um and the most common one is you just go into hbomb right and the reason this is really good is because one the corner carry is insane two ex moves are more Drive meter efficient than drive cancel combos right they use one less drive and you start recovering your drive meter quicker and you also just get a lot of extensions right so for example a couple other things you could do five heavy punch after hold up forward this is a safe jump if you want to spend try you can do his uh five medium punch Target combo into core Circle back L punch get extra damage get extra distance there's just a lot of flexibility with rotting into the ex scissor in the corner with ex scissor you get forward heavy punch into core Circle back light bomb and uh yeah it's just it's just generally metor efficient compared to doing something like this uh very similar damage but you spend a lot more drive so in general try the route into ex scissor whenever possible unless you're low drive and it's not going to kill uh in that case you can just go into you know I like to always go into bomb so crash meum punch always goes into the medium bomb uh you can also go into the psycho Crusher for a little extra damage now the issue is that you the you just don't put a bomb on them right so I personally prefer the bomb I think the bomb is really cool and it leads into a lot more potential damage or you can just get your damage you know up front with the the bomb it's kind of up to you how you want to play the character another really important combo is this punish counter for heavy punch this is going to be your shimmy normal right so anytime you want to be a throw walk back five heavy punch uh it's quite good it's a little slow so it does lose to like lay jab and stuff you got to be a little careful uh his shimmy buttons aren't the best if you want need something fast to reactor to throw with you know you can do like Crouch medium punch but this is like your preemptive shimmy is just five heavy punch right this is also your DP punish as well so five heavy five heavy kick crou M kick into the same routing we talked about a little over 3K damage plus you get a bomb setup right and obviously you can also keep this meterless as well just go in the psycho Crusher and mix one there you also be at like sometimes you'll hit five heavy punch at this range uh so just be a little careful you can get Drive rush crou medium punch that punch Crouch medium punch and the bomb again and you kind of see the same routing appearing all the time so five heavy five medium punch always goes into Crouch medum punch and Crouch medum punch is generally how you're ending almost all your combos so like this for example is a really good jumping combo there's a couple Drive Rush extensions that are good the one I recommend you learning first is after Drive Rush Crouch medium kick or Crouch medium punch stand medium punch Crouch heavy punch into the core Circle back heavy bomb and that's pretty much it um there's obviously a lot more combos you can learn um there's Cash Out combos I wouldn't focus on them too hard we'll talk about the advanced section knockdown wise generally after bomb you have to be a little careful because there's not like a great way to stop Mashers after light or medium [Music] bomb yeah so that will technically be mases and if you delay it a little bit longer you'll get extra pressure um this is why I like the heavy bomb uh because you can do Drive rush back heavy kick and that will mey and they can't they can't Mash right so just keep in mind that the knockdown after the light medium heavy bomb are all different with the heavy giving you the the most Advantage after throw it's kind of the same I like my my go-to option is Drive rush medium punch here and the cool thing about Drive rush medium punches you have two different Target combos you have uh stand medium Rouch heavy kick which goes low and you have forward heavy punch which is overhead right the issue with the overhead version is that you can just like literally Mash this out and and combo the opponent the low version of the target combo that's what this is designed to beat so if I'm just like mashing I'll you get counter hit and then you get you know you get a very basic counter counter hit combo right I generally find myself doing dyve rush medium punch as my go-to option you know after throw or after some of these knockdowns once you condition them not to mash right which this will actually beat Mash you can start to do like [ __ ] like stand medium punch and then Crouch meme kick and this hits at a very similar timing to the overhead right so it's actually like this is actually kind of pretty good mix so if they aren't falling for the overhead that means you can do something like stand medium punch crou medium kick catch their walk back and get a good amount of uh combo from there the other thing that's really important is after this bomb psycho Crusher detonates the bomb so if they're blocking and you just do psycho Crusher the bomb explodes and you're actually left at Advantage which means you can throw you can shimmy you can you know do stand medium punch so take for example this sequence right go for mixup I go into psycho crush the bomb explodes and I'm left at Advantage I can either do strike throw or shimmy right most common is throw just cuz it's a pretty easy you have to delay the throw a little bit but having the bomb on them is really nice because it essentially gives you an extra turn on knockdown the other cool thing about bomb is like let's say you don't have enough drive to like run after them right cuz you don't want to risk burnout you can just like go back to neutral and like they have to deal with the bomb either they have to approach and start attacking you or you wait for the bomb to explode and then you just go in right so the bomb is really really strong another thing I like to do is like I get the bomb of them and then I start playing this game right like what are you going to do make the bomb explode all right time to mix and now they're already in the corner and then they get throw Loops which by the way bison does have a throw loop after you know throw walk forward throw you can also do dash for throw if you're lazy I don't think dash for throw is as strong I personally like the walk forward a bit better but it's a little harder at the time and obviously your your mey options you know five medium punch Drive Rush five medium punch five heavy punch like you have a lot of different options you can mix up um you know walk back five heavy Punch To Shimmy as long as you're mixing up your options after throw in the corner that's kind of essential for the character all right so I want to talk about defense a little bit now Li's defense is trash there's not much to talk about um he has all all the supers are invincible but they're all slow which means that like if they do a fast jab on your knockdown and use super they'll be able to block in time not every character has a fast jab you have to keep in mind like you know what characters do at a higher level but basically don't use the supers that much because they supers are a lot easier to bait the ex moves right but if you are going to reversal probably level one is your best option don't use level two cuz this thing is like the level two is like super slow right like this move is not going to catch anyone that's that's halfway decent at the game psycho Crusher like this doesn't have invol this technically has invol the ex Shadows rise the issue is that it's like not very good uh so for example like even if they try to throw like you don't really get a punish you can like kind of take your turn unless they're looking out for it basically don't use it on wake up so your option your basic options are delay Tech which means that you hold down back and like do a delay throw delay BH with Crouch delay punch or Crouch medium punch they're they're both pretty good Crouch light punch can combo into Crouch medium punch on counter hit it's a a really common sequence is you know you walk for a little bit you do Crouch jab stand jab into you know scissors or ex scissors once you once you're confident your timing and then you kind of start your offense from there uh you can also just block jump out of the corner it's okay with placing this crossup is not the best you would make sure you're using jump medium kick it says best cross up technically jump light works as a cross up you know if you're playing modern or something but uh jump me kicks where it's at especially in the corner jump forward is really good too and that's mostly it his defense sucks wake up driver reversal is okay you have to be careful because it loses to the same things that lose to his wake up super also loses to but really you have to just like play really smart defense and try to find your way out you know especially if a b a character has really bad defense what you should focus on is not getting knocked down in the first place right so making the correct neutral decisions to you know maximize of your character should also be using Perry with bison now because bison's wakeups are not very strong that means people will be attacking you more with wake up Jabs or other Med attacks so use parry and hopefully you'll get lucky and get a perfect parry and you'll completely swing the momentum in your favor this will force them to use throws which then make your Invincible supers better so you need to rotate all of your options to make it unpredictable for your opponent all right so let's talk about all the tools we forgot um his jumpins heavy punch is probably the best uh is the most disjointed hit box so if you're looking to trade with their air to a or their anti-air jump heavy punch is the best jump heavy kick has the most range right so like here your jump is going to wh for jump heavy punch jump heavy kick works pretty well um I say vast majority of time using jump heavy punch jump blade punch is a little quicker um I'll occasionally use it in like situations where like they jump over my head I need something really quick that like because I'm late on reacting to jump medium punch but generally I never try to use light punch same thing with light kick I think jump medium kicks Superior in like pretty much every way oh his sweep um you're pretty much only using this to like punish other sleeps it does have really good range but I I honestly I I don't recommend using it too much if you're looking to whiff punish something actually your best option is to like let's say someone's whiffing you know and you you obviously like react with your own sleep you actually want to react with scissor kicks because your damage is just way higher than a sleep but obviously like this is like your easy with punch right so basically only use it for with Punch or the punish like someone else's sweep the Crouch me punch can be used for that too crush leg kick I didn't talk about light scaling in this game is really bad so like you don't want to do it too often but like on like a knockdown or like after Drive Rush it's pretty good the other cool thing is like lights will just naturally bait Drive reversal so if your opponent's like really Drive reversal happy you can do a crotch L and also catch people walking back uh the other cool thing is like you can also do something like Crouch L punch leg kick and then stand light punch and so you can get like a three jab combo Crouch light Crouch light stand light uh goes in the scissor kicks you can get a pretty cool mixup right so his overhead is actually quite good a 21 frame overhead reach is pretty far too the best place is like once you get this in the block run up overhead there's a huge gap they can MCH it but it's pretty good and your combo from here is just Crouch me and punch into whatever right as you can see you can kind of like Loop this [Music] sequence uh let's talk about supers level one we talked about pretty much only as a reversal on wake up uh or if it's going to kill level two you don't just throw out neutral uh generally this is only using combos if it's going to kill um I think the most common situation you use this from is is you go in the ex bomb so anything in the ex bomb level two Crouch heavy punch will also com in the level two um you can hold forward and back to direct it uh generally I just always hold back seems more consistent after ex scissor kicks you can do this [ __ ] too yeah there there's a bunch of like Choose Your Own Adventure depending on how much meter you have but generally you're only using the super unless you're going to burn them out or it's going to kill level three uh I mean standard level three Theory applies here use early in the second round if you have it or if it's going to burn them out or if it's going to kill usually you know all these combos I talked about with you know that go in the bomb you want to combo into psycho Crusher here because they do slightly more damage and then that cancels directly into level three die here all right so let's talk about advanced stuff now bison has a lot more combos than we talked about the only one I really want to teach you is like a big Cash Out combo so anytime you have the bomb on them cross medium Punch or whatever into Ex Psycho Crusher into the regular version of head uh how I say Doubles verse and the ex head stomp I've never actually land this in match M 1925 Mr this this is your basic cash shot combo does Uh crap ton of damage um but I honestly I find myself rarely in the situation to make this work and of course that works after any starter oh by the way is there any use for this move this move seems [ __ ] useless to me am I tripping oh this works oh what the [ __ ] I guess this is the thing too holy [ __ ] why did I do so much oh my God okay well I guess that's the thing too I've never actually landed this a match but if you can land that you got your yourself a willow kill clip all right so let's talk about some other Tech I think uh the other future of this character are bomb sub so the idea is that if you time the explosion correctly with something like Ford heavy punch right you get a combo into your combo of your choice now there's a few Auto sequences that I've learned that I find are quite good let's say I do a drive Rush combo into a heavy bomb dash for back heavy kick is plus un block right so heavy bomb dash dash for back heavy kick plus un block I can throw right and now if I mash forward heavy punch that hits a that hits a overhead and then you get a full combo after that right another sequence I found is I think the target combo of the bomb explosion is also really strong right so something I've been doing is something like this Dash forward leg kick hits mey throw Drive Rush Target combo into the same sequence there's a lot of different potential with this bomb subs and I feel like you just have to find the bests that work for you another really cool Corner St that doesn't necessarily use the bomb but you get the idea is after this score CLE back medium punch you do overhead and this hit mey which means that you get a combo after into another sub right so they took 3K off of a media overhead into another bomb sub yeah this character has a lot of tech to them um I think these are the best ones that I've seen so far if you find anything that's better than this let me know down in the comments below that's it for the Bison guide let me know what you guys think I think this character is strong like share subscribe if you want to see more guides on the channel I think bison is a rewarding character that rewards execution but can also has the tools to carry beginner players through the lower ranks and I think I think uh you know as long as you put in the time and practice with this character you'll be a force to reckon with anyways take care y'all and I hope you guys enjoyed bison I'll see you out on the streets that was kind of lame but whatever we keep it in there
