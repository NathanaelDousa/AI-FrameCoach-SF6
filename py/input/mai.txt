you probably clicked on this guide because you're looking to learn more about my good choice she's easy to learn as she has all the fundamental tools of Street Fighter 6 a fireball an invincible reversal and a cancelable Crouch meum kick she can also turn up the aggression with one of the best specials in the game ex fans which allow her to get in and mix up the opponent she also has great Mobility with her air dive and fast Drive rush but she also has tons of death her flame stock mechanic and a variety of combos will keep you engaged even after you've hit the highest ranks I recently hit Legend rank of my and I want to share everything I've learned along the way we'll start basic and get more advanced as the guy goes on so feel free to skip around all right now we're actually Legend and so I want to start with the top five things you should be learning when you're first starting out with M and the first is her Fireball which in my opinion is probably one of the best of not the best Fireballs in the game and the reason is it's very versatile you have three versions of the fireball like medium and heavy uh but the main advantage is you can charge these so you can do like a partial charge um which is really useful for like frame traps and and throwing the opponent off and you can do a full charge and the main benefit of full charge it kind of bounces on the opponent there's three versions The Light barely bounces the medium bounces a good amount and the heavy bounces a large amount but really what makes this Fireball strong is the EX version of it right you essentially get all the benefits of the regular Fireball but when it's ex it goes through other people's fireballs and you still get a mixup right you can do something like ex fan Dash up throw in between and it's a very very potent mixup tool and I think in order to use this Fireball the best you have to kind of understand how it works in the system of 3 fire 6 your normal Fireball actually loses to the regular Fireball and even if I throw out the charge one uh it just clashes but he takes less risk because his Fireball slow he doesn't have to charge his Fireball up right but this is where ex fan comes into play if I throw ex fan at the same time he throws his Fireball it says punish counter which means I punish the recovery of his Fireball which means I can do something like this you took almost a third of their health and you drag them all the way to the corner just for them throwing a fireball and because of that because they're really scared of this ex Fireball then you can start to get away with the rer charge Fireball right the other thing you may be wondering is like why don't I just always throw out the charge Fireball this this F this doesn't seem that good and it's not uh one of the main reasons that makes it bad is like you can actually just like hit the fan so it's uh it's it's not very strong but the main advantage if I charge a fireball with my I'm going to react to this Fireball start with a jump see I'm able to react with a punish counter and you take a bunch of damage so what the how I like to think of the regular Fireball is it's to bait out someone trying to react to my charge Fireball right so again here I try to like react to the fireball I just get anti and you can kind of continue your game from there really when you're starting out with my it's really important to understand how all the Fireballs work together in tandem the regular Fireball is used to bait them in the jumping the charge Fireball is when you get them to stay on the ground and you go in for pressure and the ex Fireballs to be other people's Fireballs or to hedge against jump because right if I try to react to ex with jump I just get an tired right you can also charge up this uh ex fan as well there's two versions you have the regular Fireball show out two fans and if you hold four and then punch you get four fans which is really really strong these are good the issue is that right you're just more susceptible being jumped if you end up getting this out uh what they what are they going to do they they can like jump forward but you can antire so you're kind of just like forced to block really and the other cool thing is like let's say I do this and then I like I can like throw in between the Gap so imagine like a full screen neutral skip that you get a mixup off of one of the best specials of the game for a reason all right the next two tips are around using the fireball as well so because this Fireballs really strong you have to keep them on the ground and the best way to do that is get really really good antire now her main she has a few antir uh for example like this back heavy kit can work not very well I never use it but it technically can work right uh this core Circle heavy punch can work too it's really rewarding but for new players what I actually recommend is just is getting really good at doing her Dragon punch or her I'm not saying this a rising her Rising knee strike the light version is nice because it kind of covers like this angle right above her and it goes pretty uh horizontal as well so even from here it still reaches now one of the disadvantages is like from like R outside round star distance if they don't hit a button they just empty jump and you do light DP it's going to whiff but if you do med medium you reach and technically heavy heavy works too um but I like to stick to just light and medium light being for when they're close medium for when they're a little bit far and of course there's like different ways to do the DP so for example you can do like you can do it from Crouching you just do down forward down forward uh you can do forward down forward forward so like this see how like I can do it like super quick or you just do it the traditional way a big mistake be my play do make is they'll do this and then they'll just go back to zoning really what you want to do is you want to go in your whole goal of this move is to deter them from jumping so you can get this charge fan out and if all you do is tack on a little bit of damage they aren't going to be scared to jump right because the reward of a jump is like way higher right like this does like triple the damage of your antire so in order to get more damage out from these situations after you do the antire you go in you have a few options right you can go for Drive Rush mixup you can go for just dash for throw you can even go for um like Med you just do tackle after and you're plus un block there's a lot of different options but the whole goal is like land that and then use that to start your offense you can even just charge a fan after if you want something really easy right but the whole goal make them pay for jumping at you all right so tip number three is to make sure you're using your ground buttons it can be really tempting to just kind of throw Fireball and wait for a jump the issue is that it loses the people just kind of like walking forward and bullying you right because if you're just waiting for the jump they get in for you for free they they hit buttons and they start chunking your drve gauge right so it's really important to make sure you're also hitting buttons such as your stand heavy kick and your stand heavy punch in order to like kind of box them out so for example if someone's just walking at me I can throw a fireball I'm not going to get much right but if I do something like this uh it's going to do a lot of damage let's say the opponent's trying to do like walk forward button and they miss and you happen to do your stand heavy kick you get some pretty decent damage and Corner carry and then you get to start your game play right ni thing about stand heavy punch is it's cancelable so on Block it's really good because you can throw your Fireball you can you can actually be plus uh this is really strong you can also just do stand heavy punch nothing in case you think they're going to di or they're going to do something else or if you want to be cheeky you can do stand heavy punch charge a fireball and they go in so you have a lot of different options off these uh off these ground pokes right there's no option from the opponent that deals with everything so for example like let's say the opponent is just like mashing medium kick after right like okay yes that's going to check me if I do the fireball at the right distance or partially hold it I'm just going to counter hit them I'm going get I'm going to get some free damage and so then the opponent's going to be like all right I'm I'm scared the medium kick then you get this charge and then you go for a throw you go for a mix tip number four is cross medum kick crou medium kick very very strong in streur because what the opponent wants to do against your buttons is make him whiff right so I can do something like this right and the way I do that is I walk back and forth what's the best way to stop someone from walking back and forth instead of like whiffing button you just go forward press crou medium kick Drive rush and now in the quarter and now they have to guess have having a cancelable Crouch medum kick is a privilege in this game and you want to make sure you're using it all right so tip number five is her level one which in my opinion is probably the best level one super in the game and the reason this is the best level one super in the game is cuz it grants you access to these flame stocks and the idea of a flame stock is that it enhances your special moves and so often times you want to land this as much as possible and you can land in a few ways you know if it's a really good antire does a bunch of damage damage you can use as a reversal on wake up as invincibility after ex Rambo and in the corner just after your heavy ramboo and there's a few other ways but those are the most common yes it gives her a little extra damage but in matchups where characters have Fireballs which is like half the cast as you can imagine like if you don't want to spend ex this can get really annoying right but if you land your fire or even just on whiff and we get back into this situation my fireballs now be his which means I control neutral and I get extra damage on my Combos and now I get I basically win the game so make sure you're using level one um there's a lot of more applications we'll talk about in the advanced section but just using it and using the enhanced Fireballs is really [Music] strong all right so let's talk about the basic combos I'm a big believer you don't want to learn too many combos when you're starting off of my so I'm only going to teach four combos any three light string she has that ends in Crouch stab or stand jab can be canceled in the light tackle very useful it's really good for like just mashing out uh it's really good for like for example I can just repeat this over and over it's just a good pressure sequence right you'll be using this one a lot second combo is after Crouch meme kick and the the combo I'm going to teach there's there's a bunch of different versions but the first I'm going to teach is this Crouch medium kick back heavy kick into Atri uo into light tackle and the reason I think this is the best one to learn is on Crouch this will restand and then the hambo will hit because if you do like a different version the hambo this move right here wh on crouching and the back heavy kick actually stands them back up the third combo is like let's say someone like with the extp you don't really want to spend this drive rush because that's like 2K damage where realistically you could do something like Crouch medum punch stand heavy punch into tackle and it does more damage and you save the drive right so this is like probably your most universal Punisher this also works on Drive reversal so for you ever block Drive reversal crou medium punch stand heavy punch and to tackle right this is also like your basic shimmy combo so if they whiff a grab you want to react with Crouch minion punch cuz it's the fastest it's it's only six frames which means it's easier to react to wh grab with and you get a bunch of damage of course you can just always do stand heavy punch into the same combo does a little less damage but still like sometimes you're not close enough to get that Crouch uh medium punch oh I also forgot if they're crouching and you land let's say you land aomo don't use HMU use something like cor heavy kick so let's talk about how to use your bar you can use it level one in the corner very strong level two and level three combo midscreen so something like this level two does a decent chunk level three you can actually cancel the light tackle into level three my advice for when you use super in this game if it's going use super if it's going to kill no question use level three most of the time you have it like if you're really down on health and you still have the around the go yes there are some exceptions but most of the times you have level three use it instead of just sitting on your your meter uh the other thing you can do is also cash out on using your drive gauge so if you know the combo is going to kill you can do something like this so as you can see same exact combo structure we basically just combined a combo in two but you did a th000 extra damage and if it's going to kill who cares if you're in Burnout all right so let's talk about mixup now even though this combo and this combo and in the same knockdown because they're kind of like floating a little bit higher when you do the the cartwheel move they're actually not the same knockdown this one is+ 30 and this is plus 27 a really strong knockdown situation after corle forward leg kick Dash forward back heavy kick if they get hit you can link a jab into the same thing and just literally keep looping this right and if they're mashing you can get an even better combo cuz this counter hit right and that way you don't have to worry about opponent smashing this is also for people that are brand new I actually don't know this I got to test they di you can di back right by the way your di combo is just this same exact thing if you do after this combo look what happens you're just going to whiff so be really careful about that if you're bu like Platinum just focus on getting the combo down and timing the mey like as they get up properly as you get better uh mix up between doing strike doing throw which again throw will beat Mash as well or doing a shimmy which is when they do like a delay throw on wake up just dashing forward walking back and doing the crash me punch right right so essentially on all the knockdowns you should just focus on doing this triangle of strike throw shimmy so after after the uh after this you can just do something like sand heavy punch fan or Dash SW walk a little bit crou me and punch right there's no like secret Auto time mey after the um hm boot jugle but what you can do compared to characters is just after after this just throw a charge fan and you can these cool little sequences like this that we'll talk about later the other thing I want to talk about is throw so midscreen her throw is actually pretty crap right you don't get much they literally Go full screen you can throw a charge fan which seems pretty good follow it in the issue of charge fan on knockdown is if they neutral Tech and they hold up forward you get cooked so you have to be really careful throw the charge fan you also throw ex fan as well ex fan is pretty good here because you kind of get out guaranteed and then you can kind of just walk forward and you know do your thing right but mid screen you don't really get that much I think your corner throw Loop's actually very strong so if you just do throw Dash forward throw again if you time it correctly it'll beat mashing so even like you do throw they try to jump out you do a DP right you can just kind of loop this right very strong forward jump you can still catch the forward jump you just input your DP the other way you get the idea you can continue the pressure so throw in the corner is very strong the only way you really beat this they can do extp whatever they you take a little bit of damage and if you happen to bait it like they just die right so whatever that's not the worst thing the other thing they can do is back dash crot jab into a combo right so you need options to beat both back Dash extp and thte so your option to beat extp and throw Tech is you just walk back slightly and then Crouch so let's say the dummy either normal throw we'll do a delayed timing we'll do parry and we'll do extp so just walking back slightly wait will beat the uh extp and of course you just kind punish with whatever you want and if you see the grab with crash meum punch into your punish combo they also start doing Parry right you can just kind of re act to whatever they do and punish so just sitting there waiting is very strong the other option you can have you can do is just hit them with a mey you have a couple options crot L kick crou L punch goes into tackle into you know the same exact situation we were showing earlier right if you think they're going to back dash probably back heavy kick is your best call out because in in the corner back heavy kick Target combo go through a level one and they just died for back dashing right fan in the corner is really strong so if you do like any knockdown charge a fan is very good I like medium fan you can throw if you think they're going to throw back you can back dash or jump so like let's say let's say we get in the block you get the idea you can do some pretty cool cool stuff like that um the only disadvantage is this obviously loses the reversal so you got to be a little careful the cool thing about me Fireballs is it beats level one supers and gp's Amnesia most notably and they do that uh they get hit and I think you get a full combo you get the idea so you can get combo like that fan is good I don't like spending ex fan here because like if they reversal you're already out 2 MERS but if you want to be like really cool you can do something like [Music] uh you got the idea so you can do some pretty cool stuff like that go for high L mix but I do think it's very resource expensive and they can kind of react to the ex Flash and just drive reversal or dpu this is going to give you all the tools to play m and what I recommend before you go even F any further in this guy get really consistent with your anti get really consistent with your Combos and make sure you can stop people from mashing on wake up right which you could just do by putting them on wake up reversal and Crouch L Punch Yeah if you can't get get that kind of stuff done consistent don't worry about the rest of the guy get the fun BS down first but if you're looking for something more advanced let's get into it I call it some more ADV Advance section because really everything else is kind of just built on top of what we talked about right there's a lot of moves I didn't cover and a lot of applications of moves I didn't cover let's get into them all right we can start for normals crou light kick Crouch light punch obviously we we kind of talked about good for light confirms stand light punch and Crouch light punch are a little bit different so light punch stand light punch has a little less range than Crouch light punch right and it's like very it's actually pretty minuscule the main disadvantage of Crouch light punch compared to STL punch is actually has less hits done if I do Crouch jab into cor of for ex doesn't combo if I do stand jab it combos other than that you use them pretty much just like crou Jabs I think your Jabs are actually better than most Jabs because they go pretty far the main downside being your cancel options aren't really the best after them for example it's kind of hard to stop someone just pressing Crouch medium punch after your jab you're just going to get counter hit right so only thing you can really do is like cancel the Rambo even that doesn't like get you that much so really the only option you have to like be really safe against uh like reversal mashing is actually just canceling ex fan it's really good you get the idea uh let's talk about her other EXs so she has ex tackle I think it's really good like if you want to go level one near the corner right so this gets me level one I can't really convert this into level one right and technically I could do like this combo but sometimes it'll whiff so a really consistent thing to do if you want to guarantee that level one is go ex jump medium punch super uh same thing with the ex flame this is really just used to go into level one most of the time again it's kind of like the closer you are to the corner the better this is let's say you're at like this this situation right here I land a punch counter this close to the corner right I think most of the time you just go for level one here because if you go for level you can't actually get level one here right cuz it's going to whiff I do I do this and then I can throw a charge fan and then they get their [ __ ] mixed right so I still get Oki when it's pretty close to the corner and I still get my flame stocks so it's it's pretty optimal then but outside of that situation I'm not really using like ex like here so to speak unless like that's going to kill oh let's talk about our dive we haven't talked about our dive at all um all the dive versions are the same light medium heavy doesn't matter what button you use on Block it's generally if you space it like at their feet it's safe and just doing like delay throw Tech after is pretty will cover most options you have to be careful though cuz like if it's spaced up here it's going to be unsafe they're just going to do a jab punish and you die you don't want to do that so because of that I don't really use this move that much really where I think it's good is against like people trying to do like normal antir right so for example like if I jump against my and she does this like I'm just going to get hit but I can do this dive bait out the normal antire and get a good mixup right um the other situation you'll you'll find yourself using this is after the target combo so she has a Target combo like kick light kick light kick into dive um you don't have to cancel into a dive this Target com is okay okay that's all I can say it's not amazing I think you can get by without it um it's kind of just like it's very easy to auto pilot you just dial in the dive when you see it hit and if not you can just bounce away the issue is that it's kind of gimmicky because like against a lot a lot of the cast for example in the mamir match yeah so that's punish this but so some characters can punish it you just have to be a little careful on hit it's actually pretty good probably better on hit than just going the tackle the issue is that compared to Jabs your pressure is just basically done if uh if they block this right uh after this tackle you actually just hold up forward and get a safe jump which means that they can't reversal as long as you're as long as you're holding guard and if they happen to neutral Tech you still get the safe jump they just you're just going to cross up right another thing about sand like it's the best for shimmies so for example like if you're shiing after Drive rush if you do stand jab or cross jab you might get thrown however you do St L kick less a chance to get thrown because it has more push back uh stand medium kick this button is okay um it's kind of like Terry stand medium kick except unlike Terry you can't get amazing damage on punish counter you can't do like level one punish counter you can't do level two punish counter which is kind of cool also like at certain ranges this will this will combo but it's like doesn't work nearly like anywhere close to max range oh it works on counter hit oh yeah it does that's pretty cool so it looks like max range it'll always work on punish counter but not on counter hit um also accompass in the sweep too like at like this kind of range there like think of as like a very low committ whiff Punisher compared to something like stand heavy punch which like leans you forward right however I think for whiff punishing this the stand medium punch is probably one of your best options it goes far it combos into corle forward ex um even from like almost max range you just got to be really careful cuz like sometimes if you hit like something extended it won't combo uh but this is pretty nice as a whiff Punisher as opposed to like doing Drive Rush which like uses more up more meter right but they're both still pretty good I didn't talk much about our Drive rush but our Drive Rush is okay the issue is our Drive Rush is fast but the buttons you can do out of it aren't that strong um I think back heavy Kick's probably like the best one for like Oki or on block cuz like it leaves you in throw range and you're the most plus uh but crou heavy punch is also pretty decent um it comes out faster and you're still plus right so you can do Crouch jab and get a hit confirm um the other thing where this is useful is technically this is slightly more optimal this does like 20 extra damage than than this so I guess if you want to be like a [ __ ] sweat Lord and you want to squeeze out that extra damage you can you can do that instead I I I show overhead earlier but like Drive Rush overhead obviously really good crash medum punch into you know Ender your choice all right jump normals jump BL punch uh okay an air to air honestly never use this thing jump blade kick okay cross up jump medium kick I think is a better cross up so use jump medium kick jump medium punch is an air to air so if you react to them jumping you can get some okay damage and it's not the best air there in the game but it's uh it's serviceable right jump heavy kick has the most range of her jumpings so we'll reach from round start where most other jumpins don't right jump heavy punch I think is our most underrated normal you get that it's kind of like a uh can jump heavy punch where you can hit really early in your jump Arc and it'll still hit them so if I do this back heavy kick late I'm just getting SW SWAT it out of my back heavy kick so it's really good for punishing people that aren't very good at anti recommendation jump Min kick for cross up heavy punch for when you want to stuff something or like you jumped over a fireball and heavy kick for range all let's talk about burnout pressure so her burnout pressure is like not as good as you think it would be but she has a couple cute things she can do in Burnout this is kind of cute so this is zero on block so like it can catch a lot of people unaware and the cool thing is if they super after like let's say they super after the reimo and you press jab see how my Jabs coming out um you can actually just cancel the the parry and then you know mess them up for trying to do the super the issue is that they can just it's kind of gimmicky because they can they can just like trade with you and now you're like even uh probably the nicest thing is this is actually Plus on block now so this Crouch medium punch kind of moves you forward a little bit and your plus same thing with uh stand me heavy punch too so you can use these normals and burn out as as well to kind of like convert frame trap so you can use cute stuff like heavy punch light ramboo light Rambo heavy punch right like you you see the idea there's some cute stuff you can do but probably the cutest thing she can do is actually really strong and she has really good CH chip sequences in the corner by doing stand heavy punch charge fan if they get hit you know you actually just get a combo here light re light re ambo DP if they're not mashing okay crou medum punch and then Loop it over and over and none of this can be mashed you get the idea and that does a crap ton of uh chip not to mention you can mix up throw and other stuff yeah and obviously fire stocks it's it's going to be better that's pretty much all I got I think um I have some Advanced Tech to show so do I do questions first okay qu I I'll take any questions but if I already answer in the guide I'm not repeating it our most important Oki to practice uh just being able to time meaty throw after tackle and understanding like How To Shimmy and how to like do this over and over like that's that's really if you can if you can practice that and make sure you got the timing down you'll be golden CR heavy feels kind of bad um I think yeah it is pretty bad honestly um but I think it it's okay drive Rush technically it's probably like technically more optimal to punish certain things like like so for example like here if I have to punish counter something from here it's not going to work but like here I can get like a punish counter hit hey overhead Mees course go back medium punch with stand leg kick overhead plus four on block you can go into I mean plus four on hit you can actually go straight into Target combo go into level one you get the idea uh pretty cool all right let's talk about Twitter Tech uh I'll start from the bottom all this is alternative punish to stand heavy kick punish counter the idea being you get these like weird juggles and you can go into Super uh it's definitely slightly more optimal that way uh same kind of thing here nice Corner carry and you can you know do Mei fan setups as well these are some my stun combos I'll link this Twitter this this clip but technically these are the most optimal combos you can do after a stun uh obviously depends on like the fire stocks and if you want to spend super um but realistically like you'd only do this if it's going to kill this is a a cool thing about fire stocks so because when you have fire stocks here you can kind of continue the combo longer you can get way more damage using this route 6K for someone jumping at you is probably some of the best in the class oh this is another example of burnout pressure I haven't quite used this yet but I it's obviously like very situational very cute right get a bunch of Chip get that di pretty scary obviously you can mix up like throws and that sort of thing so this is Uma if you have fire stocks you could trade the fireball with like a jump normal and you can do chunks millionaire exclusive Tech I thought this sequence was pretty cool so the idea of this is after you land level one um and you have two bars you want to be able to like get a confirm at the level three right so this this this combo actually builds a full drive and then you know you can go in the critic C but this this starter here is actually pretty decent if you just want something like kind of jail them in the place just drive Rush ex fan because even on Block it's a really good situation and I just want to show this if you want to be like super sweat this is after you're after you hit 2100 Mr if you want like some swag combos you can do something like this yeah at me in the comments when you land this one and people are still finding stuff you know check the hashtag this is literally posted an hour ago there's a lot of cool stuff that you can do with this character and I'm sure people will keep finding stuff all right now we play game of ranked and then I think we call it but yeah that's the end of gu if this was useful like share subscribe and I'll catch you on the next one I show my best my mods [ __ ] you right oh god oh I I I didn't confirm counter oh my God he's walking back a lot going to cross medium kick into drive rush into combo go for throw see what he does throw Loop because he's close to the corner going to keep doing it until oh he back Das me he misses uh Crush jab ooh that perfect fa to kind of clutch it out um I don't know if this level one is worth it but now I get uh fan pressure and now you're dead so I no he back medium punch so I'm going to try jumping in a bit more because it means he's not ready for the uh oh that's my G right there oh I'm Miss going to burn him out Crouch dab and to Ru to kind of get some extra chip and he's dead look for something I knew he was going to do it overhead all right go into uh I think I'm going to go into ex fan pressure oh I could have got a crazy juggle there oh I thought he was oh oh I missed my mey all right see if he knows yeah Crouch light into ramboo kind of cheap all right I'm a shimmy this time oh I should have grabbed that all right GG's but yeah that's how you play uh that's how you play M like sure subscribe
