what's up YouTube this is Veggie and I'm back with another video this video is a guide on how you can play zangi in Street Fighter 6 I will try to go through the various aspects of the character and how to approach with it covering the ground game the offense and the defense zang's main strength lies in his button game accompanied by a strong anterior option and great punishes while being slower than the average character this is made up for with longer range on buttons with great hit in her boxes zang's main goal is generally cornering the opponents by slowly walking them down punishing attempts at striking him while also dealing damage to the drive bar and moving close close enough for an SPD or button press in neutral zangi will mainly use his crouching light punch standing medium punch standing medium kick standing heavy punch and his crouching medium kick to control the ground and put the opponent in a situation where zangi can Thrive zangi uses his standing light kick his crouching heavy kick his standing medium punch and his crouching heavy punch when with punishing the opponent and zangi can get his pressure going in neutral on block through Drive Rush with standing light kick or counter standing medum punch and a counter standing heavy punch crouching light punch is the tool that carries the least risk of being punished reaction and when it is in range of the body H box of the opponent it will rarely lose as as long as it becomes active is a great way of stopping a character that wants to get into a range where they can hit a button on block and get their pressure going or walk up for a throw the downsides to this button is that it leads to little reward on hit and can be suspectable to preemptive counters through an opponent's buffer or preemptive heavy this is where zang's other button starts to shine for instance if the opponent is buffering with a low recovery medium to catch our crouching light punch then we can get counter it and punish counter knockdowns going from a standing medium Punch or standing heavy punch these will also be safe on block and give great reward on counter it and punish counter if the opponent is trying to pre tively beat our crouching life punch with a heavy we can try to bait out their heavy and then reaction with punish them with our button of choice the greatest reward comes from Crouching heavy kick and crouching heavy punch midscreen but towards the corner even a standing like driver crouching medium punch down forward medium punch Lariat and a stand medium punch Target combo would provide great Oki use your with punish according to the opponent's character Tendencies and the position on the screen as well as based on the available resources that you have and the opponent has Dy meum punch has a great hitbox to hit box ratio and will avoid a lot of normals in the mid-range it's with punishable by hit boxes that hit higher on the move and lower on the move but if it's in range it's very good at straight up beating the opponent's button presses and getting opportunities through the counter it or punish counter standing heavy punch carries great risk on whith but if it's used within its range it's a strong tool to deal Drive damage regular damage and land counter it and punish counter knockdowns either on reaction or just by Chance the closer the opponent is to the corner the better the Oki from the counter it and punish counter knockdowns are the button when pressed has armor until active frames if the button is held slightly we get three armor frames on the 16 frame verstion of the move this takes a little practice but it's worth learning while we are holding the button we will have armor until it's released holding the standing heavy punch can be countered by a raw Drive Impact but the opponent will have to be ready for it the Oki on the full hold version on counter it is similar to the non-charge but it has more plus frames at plus 40 so it can provide Oki from even further away from the corner the fully charged punish counter standing heavy punch provides a hard knockdown at plus 54 that will provide a plus 10 situation after a Double Dash or Oki if an extended Drive Rush is done after landing the move we can also do a dash and then drive rush but the most consistent and strongest Oki comes from Drive rushing immediately afterwards standing medium kick carries lower risk than both standing heavy punch and standing medium punch but also less reward it's harder to with punish and can be a great substitute for standing medium punch and standing heavy punch when trying to control the opponent it is also a great button to close out rounds as the risk reward becomes even greater when a single standing medium kick will kill the opponent crouching medium kick can be used a little bit further away than standing medium punch but carries the same risk of whiff punishment it has less reward on hit in terms of damage and potential knockdown but the good part about incorp ating this tool in the ground game control is that it will make the opponents Crouch more limiting their movement and making it harder for them to get to their preferred position in addition when crouching the H box of a character is larger than when they are standing so when we make our opponents Crouch it will be easier to place our buttons on block crouching heavy kick can also be used similarly to crouching medium kick but at a greater risks since in many ranges and versus many characters it can be very punishable on block the reward on counter it and punish counter is very high providing the strongest Oki position for zangi in the game and the reward on regular hit is often a pseudo OK situation that requires conditioning for the SPD to work forward M kick and forward heavy punch are generally used in pressure situation and for Oka situations but depending on the condition and the position of the opponent they do have uses in neutral but more sparingly crouching Li kick is the easiest checking to four frame low with great range but at a much lower reward than slower checks if the opponent is continuously using something like a driver Rush then trying to focus on checking with a slower button with more reward can be a good choice but as long as they are using these option sparingly the crouching Li kick is a great choice zangi is pretty good at dealing with fireballs and I have already uploaded a guide that covers this and I think it is still relevant in the current patch if this changes in the future I might make an updated guide that addresses this using these tools efficiently will force the opponent to act as blocking Heavies and mediums from zangi will drive the drive bar substantially over time and the opponent will have to either try to make zangi with or move in for a button press themselves identifying when someone will go for a button press and when they will try to make us with and even when they might try to jump in on us will allow us to control the neutral and Corner the opponent in some match ups the use of buttons alone will be difficult as the opponent will have options that are very hard to deal with through the use of the ground game only when jumping with zangi mixing up the various options in the air can help create an opening on an opponent if an opponent's antiair goes straight up then empty jumping might allow us to punish the antiair when we land and if the opponent's antiair is slow or has a weak hit to herbox ratio then maybe a jump medium kick or jump light kick could stuff it before it becomes active zang's Jump game can be very strong in some matches it comes down to the risk versus reward for instance jumping in on a g with no level three that is not charging flash kick is not really that risky as the antier does not lead too much and the damage is low while if the jump was successful it would create a really strong position for sangi both on hit and block jumping heavy punch and jumping heavy kick is really good to get the most damage out of a jumping situation jumping medium punch has great range but little active frames and can be used in situations like the fake safe jump mix-up after he acceler it neutral jump headbutt is the highest damage jumping noral that zangi has and the best one for starting combos let let's cover the Oki from the various knockdowns the plus 27 knockdown the knockdown plus frames will receive after a standing medium punch Target combo and a close larat combo is the most common knockdown we land this knockdown is very strong when the opponent is near to the corner or in the corner as after this knockdown we can go for an immediate dver rush into a forward heavy punch and we will be plus 11 on block and plus 15 on hit meaning that both on hit and block we can go for a second forward heavy punch as part of our mixup as it will beat a reversal for frame we can also go for an immediate Drive rush into forward medium kick that will be safe to drive revers and plus four un block and combo into down four me punch on hit closer to the corner this knockdown provides the option to dash up throw or Dash up SPD as an Alo time meting or walk up throw and walk up SPD or even a walk up forward heavy punch in the plus 27 knockdown we will have enough plus frames to bait the reversal if we go for blocking after our Drive reversal so the scenario is very strong the plus 45 knockdown which is a knockdown we often get from Landing a punish counter or counter it sweep is probably the strongest knockdown we have this knockdown lets us do a manually timed safe jum the safe Gump plus frames for sangi is 43 to be safe from six frame DPS so there is a manual delay of two frames but we can also go for empty Gump Mix-Ups to beat both the light DP and the Parry I like going for the safe jump setup as I find the Oki very strong we can also Dash up and do all the normal pressure with fourward heavy punch lights regular throw or command throw and we can do a frame kill crouching Li kick to be plus 27 and do all the good options we get from the plus 27 knockdowns with the double forward heavy punch Etc if we get a plus 28 knockdown which can be achieved after a level two super in the corner by doing the latest possible possible down forward medium punch into Lariat on the juggle we get the same OK options as the plus 27 knockdown but we will have even more plus frame the plus 29 knockdowns which are generally achieved when Landing a level one super or any of the non-closed Running Bear grabs allows us to get a driver forward medium kick that is plus six on block and plus 11 on hit or a driver's light SPD or a driver's standing medium Punch or driver's into crouching light kick Etc all of these need to be manually timed for instance an immediate driver forward medium kick will lead to a whiff forward medium kick with the exception of when we land at level one when the opponent is cornered we can do an immediate Drive Rush forward medium kick to get the best possible scenario the plus 19 knockdown from the aird the Bor Dynamite is not too strong as we can't keep safe from Reversal ex DP if we driver depending on the DP we might be able to be safe from it by doing a driver's immediate throw or driver's immediate stump but in general the situation is not too strong when Landing level two we can get reload side switch or high damage and High super metor build it depends on what we want to achieve and what character we are fighting holding the level two and going for dash down forward medium punch Lariat will provide a plus 30 knockdown that allows for a driver SPD forward heavy punch standing medium punch forward medium kick crouching light kick Etc if we want higher damage we can go for a dash down forward medium punch air exd if we are comboing into level two after quite a few hits down forward medum punch into EX air SPD or B Dynamite loses its value as the damage killing will affect it heavily for its cost and the position afterwards in these scenarios going for either the frame kill into safe jump or Dash down for Med punch larat is just as good as the reward after landing the air the Expos Dynamite but will actually in general provide a better reward because if we think that the level two can kill and we don't have a level one super then by not inputting anything we can get the Jackhammer which will deal the most damage if you want to get the corner from the level two holding back will lead to the best option at plus five where we can condition the opponent into blocking and then use forward medium kick forward heavy Punch or walk up SPD this does 100 less damage but is well worth it if the super won't kill and we want to have the corner I have not really found any real use for the whole forward version of the super as we are only plus one and quite far away from the opponent if we do lights into level two and have level one then going into level one will provide a bit more damage than going for the Jackhammer we can do Dash down for medum punch into the level one or in the corner standing heavy kick and then juggle into level one if we want big damage and big oky and we don't have too much Skilling going into the level two then going for das down for Min Punch or standing heavy juggling to level one provides both good damage and good Oki plus 38 is the plus frames we get after the ex Lariat on ground opponents and if the ex connects close enough provides a real throw button command throw mixup so ending the down four medium punch firm and the forward heavy punch into down for me punch combo in ex larat is good for both damage and the follow-up Oki the further way our ex larat connects the harder it will be to get a regular throw going but we will almost always be able to get a forward medium kick or a stting medium Punch or maybe even a forward heavy Punch or light SPD to be real in the scenario Exar as an antier gives a little bit worse plus frames and the throw is not often guaranteed but we will very often be in a position to do either standing medium punch forward medium kick forward heavy Punch or light SPD it can be close enough for medium heavy and ex SPD and throw depending on how how close the opponent was when they jumped at us remember to hold forward after the ex lar connects until the active animation is finished to get the closest to the opponent as possible this is also important for the regular Lariat ex Lariat as an antier can be ComEd into level two and then followed up by an air exd borch Dynamite or a level one which can lead to a Kill from an antier even when the opponent has quite a bit of Health left the SPD OK situations are really condition based as after any SPD dri rush into stand light kick will beat back dash and back jump as well as wake up button it is a lot easier to time this after the light punch SPD which is plus 30 than the medium heavy and exds which are plus 28 but from testing it should be possible when conditioned after doing things like driver standing like kick driver sweep Etc we can get a driver's SPD I recommend learning to pre-b buffer the motion during the drivers and ending in up plus the punch button when we are in range this will make the S SPD harder to delay button or delay jump out of there is no true answer in this mixup and there are so many ways of creating opportunities delay button to catch delay jumps drivers block to catch Parry which can be reaction punished with the SPD or bait the drive impact which can be en countered by our own Drive imp or maybe see that the opponent isn't moving so we hit them with an SPD after doing a drive rush into block or driver rush into nothing then delay button to catch them pressing there are so many options after this and there is so much room for creativity but conditioning and recognizing what the opponent might want to do is key here in any case with enough Drive bar the drivers stand likei into drivers will provide a very strong mixup where going into the crouching medium kick is a true string which will catch the opponent if they're trying to do a reversal with a standing input and again conditioning is key this means we can get a real SPD mix of going here as well as the opponent might be afraid of trying to do a reversal after the block standing likei after the close suplex which can only be done when you're very close and doing the running bur grab input on regular hit we will be plus 26 and on EX we will be plus 27 both of these allow us to do a driver slide SPD or a dver forward medium kick that is AO time that will be plus un block and plus enough on hit to combo into down forward medium punch we can of course also do the driver standing medium punch driers crouching Li kick and when conditioned drivers forward heavy punch Etc Sang's regular throw game is very good in out of six his best throw is a down forward throw which is plus 33 on hit and it will Loop into a real throw loop with drivers it can provide manually timed options for double forward heavy punch with a driver rush it allows for a dashup forward heavy punch and a Dash up light SPD in the corner it also Loops into itself without driver rush for a throw Loop we can frame kill with one stump which leaves it as plus five for a perfect medy throw or SPD I prefer to dash first and then manually time the throw or command throw or after the dash go for a for heavy punch on a punish counter this throw Loops into itself without Drive Rush even mid screen zang's back throw is his best position from the Sid switch throws it leaves him at plus eight and if zangi throws the opponents into the corner or lands this as a punish counter back throw it provides a real OK situation where we can land crouching medium punch and then dri preemptively light SPD medium SPD exd and level three and when the opponent is conditioned we can even go for things like forward heavy punch zang's neutral throw has an added option that allows for zangi to hold the throw buttons to get a follow up on the throw this will allow zangi to deal 1800 damage if the throw lands as a punish counter it will actually deal as much as 2,640 damage it also provides provides a throw up in the corner so if the opponent is at around 2,640 health and corner it is very valuable to go for this throw if you get the punish counter you hold it in end the round and if you don't get a punish counter you can still apply pressure zangi has more throws if we want to create more space after back throw the down back or down throw is a good option forward heavy punch is an excellent pressure tool a regular forward heavy punch is plus eight on hit and plus four on block this means that we can use it as a combo tool into down for medum Punch or crouching medium punch and follow up from there where regular Larry gives Oki near to and in the corner and the ex lar will give Oki anywhere on the screen as well as combos into supers Etc it is also a very good frame trap tool and we can use it to set up real command throws and regular throws as an example we can do a forward heavy punch into an SPD this will beat any attempted button press for the opponent similarly a forward heavy punch into down for medium punch will beat a button press from the opponent when conditioned we can go for multiple forward heavy punches draining Drive bar and forcing the opponent to act delay button is a good answer to the forward heavy punch from the opponent and to catch this without our forward Min Punch or other buttons we need to do a the L for ourselves hair and SPD would still work and be an easier solution the possibilities for conditioning and opening the opponents are many and using different buttons in between the forward heavy punches will make it harder for the opponent to get out of the situation since the forward heavy punch is plus four on block it leads to a true string if you go into a crouching light kick which will beat any attempted reversal that has a standing input in it when Landing the forward heavy punch after rers it's plus 12 on hit and plus eight on block these numbers can increase if it lands mey meaning it's harder to do a delay button to catch the second forward heavy punch and it also means that we need to the lay R down forward medum punch crouching L Punch or crouching medium punch if you want to catch them jumping pressing or back dashing the forward medum kick is also a great tool to keep the pressure going or getting in when the opponent is relatively close to us there is a true block string that will set up for a perfectly spaced forward me kick by going for Point Blank crouching light kick crouching light kick crouching light punch into forward me kick this forward me kick will be plus two on standing block and plus one on crouching block after this we can mix in crashing light kick light SPD sometimes medium SPD or exd delay forward heavy punch delay standing medium punch Etc the opponent can more easily press to challenge a forward medium kick after a recent patch and the forward medum kick can now be punishable and PLU depending on the spacing making us having to be aware on possibly punishing the opponent for the reversal button press or simply delaying the forward medium kick so that it does not get hit by the reversal button it still works the same versus reversal Lowes like crouching medium kicks so it's still a very strong option but it requires a little bit more conditioning now for instance after our block string we could go into a delay button or an immediate button depending on the opponent's character and the tools that they have available to them to catch them pressing and condition them to not press after our block strs to get the for me kick to be plus two on crouching block we must do it in a Range where it whiffs on standing block so always trying to use it in the range where it's plus two on standing and plus one on crouching is optimal it also triggers proximity guard if we are close enough when using it which is the case after Point Blank crouching like it crouching like it crouching light punch even midscreen down forward medium punch is an excellent luux string Ender since it's a confirmable button with a generous confirm window allowing us to get Mix-Ups even when there is only one button pressed left in our stram when we have level three or critical art we can actually confirm it into very high damage killing the opponents at really high healths a normal scenario with standing like drivers into crouching medium punch which is plus three on block and then either an SPD or a down forward medium punch with the down forward medium punch is confirmable into Lariat and ex Lariat and will beat the opponent trying to jump out or back dash and the SPD will beat the 4frame button and the block if the opponent presses after a crouching medium punch in this scenario our down forward medium punch will trade but we will be plus seven most of the time and we can continue to combo into standing light kick we should consider our dry bar and what the combo will lead to before doing this though using lights it's also a strong offense tool as doing lights can be further crumbled into drivers and then again into crouching light punch down for be punch Lariat which can lead to a plus 27 knockdown which has real Oki in the corner or close to the corner or we can reset when we land the driver's crouching light punch which is plus 10 meaning we have a real mixup with forward heavy Punch or SPD the forward heavy punch will trade with a four-frame button but it will still allow us to combo from there chaining into crouching light kick or crouching light punch from a crouching light kick or a crouching light punch will provide a true block string but when going into a standing light punch we will no longer have a true block string but the standing light punch is better when comboing into the drive rush or doing the drive Rush on block from light strings as it can provide a true block string on block with crouching light kick and be plus enough for us to run closer before doing a crouching life punch on hit remember that when comboing into lights and the opponent's health is low we might be able to land a kill if we dump all our Drive bar into the combo when doing a regular standing light kick into drivers on block we can keep our block Shing True by going for a crouching light kick this crouching liick will be plus one unbl block and if the opponent presses they will beat our followup SPD but they will lose to a slightly delayed second crouching liick we can also change from the crouching Li into the standing light punch and then command throw after that as it is plus two unblock a four-frame buttton will lose to the SPD with the way Zang gives forward heavy punch Works doing a d crouching light kick crouching light kick crouching light punch and then forward heavy punch we will actually Al the with punish if they then decide to press a foref frame our SPD will also work here even though we're just plus one defending a zangi is interesting because while we technically don't have the strongest defensive options we also have more life than the average character at 11,000 and as a result of this we can afford to take more risks on defense generally though trying to block them out is a smart option as it comes with low risk unless we are close to burnout we can also sort of force a defensive mixup by trying to land either a perfect Parry or a jump cancel SD I have a guide on how to do the jump cancel spds if you want to learn how to do this s GES level two will beat a lot of Heavies some mediums and throws so it is kind of risky to use as a reversal option but if we have a good read we can turn the ties by getting the corner when we have a level three or critical Arc we have the best defensive option in the game as it can only be avoided by a back dash or a jump so pressuring becomes increasingly dangerous as the zangi can end round when the opponent is at 4,800 Health with level three and at 5,300 Health with critical Arc we can also mix in jump out and back dash and then mix our follow-ups after that we will seldomly be in a position to punish after back dashing a throw but it will probably be our turn and we can get some mixup going when jumping out of the corner a splash can connect if the opponent is walking up for a throw if they were point blank when you went for the jump throw the splash is likely to whiff and they can punish on Landing so use the splash accordingly the same goes for the jumping light kick rotating all of these options every now and then or when we have a good read on the opponent as well as just blocking and taking some throws can be a good way of eventually escaping pressure checking drivers is mostly done with crouching light kick and can be done on reaction without really looking for the drivers a lot of the time but this leads to low reward so if someone is abusing Rush attempting to go for a better punish is well worth it when Zang is in Burn outstanding heavy punch is an excellent tool to deal with Drive Impact it can be done on reaction if you're looking for it either in neutral or after a button unblocked as long as the button into drive impact has at least a four frame gap between the block stun and the drive impact the standing heavy punch can be used if there is less than a four frame Gap we need to use either level two or level three this is not the only way to play zangi but it's the way that I Tred to play zeni and I hope I could provide some good information on how the character works optimal Combos and optimal punishes can vary a lot depending on which patch you're watching this guide on so as the game is updated I will try to upload the current optimal Combos and punishes if that is of interest thank you so much for watching the video I really hope you like the video If you like the video feel free to like the video if you have anything to say just comment away and I would really appreciate it if you could subscribe to my channel thank you so much and until next time bye [Music]
