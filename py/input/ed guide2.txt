when you play Ed this is what you're doing right you're like let me hold space you know you know do a little bit of zoning Everybody Plays Ed so solid like you know all this kind of stuff none of this all right don't do this because if you try to play solid that's correct but it's really hard when you're new let me teach you some stuff about ad this is unblockable just neutral jump and then do this after okay I promise you no one's going to block this the second thing that I will say that's really good with Ed to do in New besides like the normal stuff like this and everything else like this or whatever is he actually has a very good driver's jab his driver's jab and crouching jab are both extremely good you should use these this into this is like really good like and you hit medium punch after it's a trade and that trade is really good for you because you know you're in the other thing is this move is solid I would say this move is very good you could do this a lot for heavy Bunch also so in general just Fireball this into drive vers this is like always solid that was a true block string the other thing that I think is really good is heavy punch light flicker this is a true block string that they can't di that's minus 6 with a lot of push back look at the the drive gauge on Luke it's about one bar of Drive gauge things like this and like back it up this is always solid see that s medium kick flicker is very good it is diable so one thing I would recommend is doing this so that if your opponent is like reversal diing all the time you can just do this and be like Oh bet or big Fireball the other thing is you should do this string this is a general thing people do right they Mash crouching light punch on you after the third hit so you try to do light light light into like some move right if you just do light Blitz this is a combo and you do crouching light kick after and then when they stop mashing right they're like okay I'm no longer going to mash you can do this and you got all this space right or you can do like this light Blitz is punishable though yeah I mean if they block and punish light Blitz right then um you just do this head has some of the best like offense off of his blocked normals of any character in the game cuz like he just has lots of flexibility with a five frame crouching leg kick that reaches that far if they start to do reversal crouching light punch to beat my crouching light kick Blitz beats that which is very powerful so you have ways to be both of their mashes four frames or six frames off of your your minus this move goes very very far as you can see it's safe on block and you can hit confirm it pretty late canc and stuff like this right is really really nice he also has a tar combo of it or you can do things like this or you can see that it hits and then do this any tips for learning multiple characters it felt very demoralizing to lose his ter and then go back to my main and lose I mean why should you take a week off your character and then be the exact same power level when you come back you know what I mean why you put that expectation on yourself who can do that who can like take a week off their character and then be the exact same when they get back I mean no one right the wler even he comes back at a reduced power level that's the secret
