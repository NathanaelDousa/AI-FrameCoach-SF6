I've spent a lot of time playing JP and Street Fighter 6 and so I've decided to make a season 2.5 guide for the character part one of this guide will focus on buttons specials and supers while part two will go in depth into game plan pressure Combos and setups please enjoy standing light punch is your go-to driver versal punish tool its range allows you to extend light attack string crouching light punch is your fastest button use it to punish moves interrupt safe block strings and frame trap your opponent when you have the advantage standing light kick is used to punish M bison scissor kicks and not much else crouching light kick is JP's fastest low used to open up the opponent on block jumping light punches as jumping light kick can cross up at certain angles making it a useful tool to open the opponent up it quick startup makes it a great air to air and a tool used in double overhead mixups standing medium punch is a slow longrange poke that does an impressive amount of Drive gauge chip crouching medium punch is a great Drive Rush check tool while also being great out of Drive Rush it's also a vital combo tool all around great button standing medium kick has many of the same strengths as crouching medium punch with some different combo capabilities overall a great tool crouching medium kick is a safe on block plus after Drive Rush advancing low that has great combo reward on hit this is JP's largest safe low but watch out as it can go under some attacks jumping medium punch is basically standing medium punch but in the air it has absurd range for an aerial attack and it range makes it a good defensive option jumping medium kick is JP's strongest airto a allowing him to combo afterward this button is also used in many of his most practical and most damaging combos sing heavy punch is JP's greatest button in combos enabling a lot of his damage potential while its unique juggle property makes it vital in combos it is also a solid pokon its own and grants crumple State on punish counter leading to additional damage crouching heavy punches JP's go-to anti-air it is also JP's fastest heavy normal making it a good combo tool standing heavy kick is JP's only Plus on block normal it whiffs against crouching opponents at the distance but on hit or block it allows JP to start bowling the opponent great button crouching heavy kick is a very Niche tool its poor range makes it a bad poke but it is a sweep that is safe after Drive rush and is fast enough to be used for easy Oki after perfect Parry it's also used as a frame kill and rarely a combo Ender jumping heavy punch is a rarely used tool but it has a unique knockdown property that enables JP to do some cheeky resets [Music] jumping heavy kick is JP's primary jump in tool please use this button back medium punch is a good tool out of Drive Rush due to its low push back on block allowing you to either hit confirm or go into a level two sequence there is also good combo filler out of Drive Rush lights forward medium kick is a slow but safe unblock overhead that is plus after Drive Rush use this in conjunction with crouching medium kick to mix up the opponent as both lead to the same situation on hit down forward heavy punch is JP's longest range button it's highly punishable on block but it knocks the opponent down on hit leading to some decent pressure forward heavy kick is a useful anti-air range as crouching heavy punch cannot cover leads the combos in Hit and has a unique juggle property that makes it a vital combo tool the second hit whiffs on crouching opponents making it a bad neutral poke JP's back medium punch medium punch Target combo is a combo filler tool used to get that extra hit in but does not have much use beyond that JP's heavy kick heavy punch Target combo is a great tool to start pressure at a safe distance it special cancel property allows you to throw fireballs and it's high block Sun allows you to use it in level two pressure pressing heavy kick or heavy punch after this target combo creates a high low mixup however aside from this uncommon level two sequence it's never used JP's air throw always sides switches making it a useful tool to counter neutral jumps in cornered instantly turning the tides of a match JP's spike is an important zoning and combo tool when zoning it assists JP in locking the opponent down at long distances becoming very effective when paired with a portal in combos spike is a good Ender due to his range and juggle potential JP spike is minus two unblock but has 10 active frames this means that you can very easily make it a plus unblock mey OD Spike loses the combo utility of its meterless counterpart in favor of natural plus frames and double deactive frames making it useful when dealing chip damage to the opponent as an oky tool and as a rare combo Ender for that last hit JP swipe is his primary special move combo tool the light version combos from his light attacks the medium and OD versions combo from his mediums and the heavy version only combos after dri rush or counter hit heavy attacks the OD and heavy versions are both plus unblock and cause a wall Splat on hit but the heavy version allowing for greater combo potential all four versions are frequently used in combos most most JP players choose classic over modern specifically because the modern control scheme lacks the medium and heavy versions of this move this means that the modern control scheme lacks a lot of combos JP's portals are his most threatening zoning and mixup tools it takes 50 frames for JP to set the portal and when it detonates it has the same active frames as a spike special JP can combo off the portal with forward heavy kick or standing heavy punch when detonated it is plus 10 unblock making it a frame trap with standing heavy punch and standing heavy kick teleporting out of the portal is a good option for positioning and for baiting parries the OD version summons two portals in 40 frames which means it has expanded combo setup and neutral utility compared to its counterpart for example JP can combo into and out of OD departure after landing a punish counter standing heavy punch Amnesia is a useful defensive tool for JP this is a frame three counter that works on any strike activating Amnesia summons a bomb that will go off even if JP is hit the opponent can drive impact throw or super to nullify the bomb this tool allows JP to get out of some Checkmate scenarios that would work on other characters however spamming Amia when burned out in the corner is not always worth going for as many characters have buttons that have only a one or two frame gap on burned out opponents thus beating the move the advantage after activating Amia is determined by the recovery frames of the move that it is triggered on if he counters light attacks then the opponent gets to do Oki on his wake up but if he counters heavy attacks then he gets to do a combo OD Amnesia has three important distinctions from regular Amnesia it's frame one instead of frame three it spawns two orbs in the opponent instead of one requiring different combo routes and it counters throws and safe jumps in addition to strikes only losing to projectiles countering a throw while in the corner allows JP to combo with standing medium kick or a back throw JP's Fireballs only become active when they are close enough to the opponent where the ghost will then swipe this means that a fast enough opponent can Dash through the fireball as the swipe will take too long to come out JP's medium Fireball is an overhead that is only active for a single frame an up close hit JP can combo into crouching light punch JP's heavy Fireball is a low the same properties as his medium Fireball but with less combo applicability JP's light Fireball is a mid attack that sacrifices damage for active frames and a knockdown SL juggle State on a hit the extra active frames allow it to hit opponents in more situations by holding down the button JP can faint any one of these three fire balls which is useful for an opponent with a Parry habit OD fire Fireball is active and locks the opponent more than any other move in his kit allowing JP to reposition set up a portal or go for a mixup additionally it is a great combo Ender watch out against certain characters JP is a ranged command grab with the same startup as drive impact and a long recovery the grab is similar to his Fireballs with three active grab frames starting with the projectiles close to the opponent this move should be used sparingly to throw the opponent off guard the OD version does more damage and goes through regular fireballs [Music] JP's level one supers strike and throw in vulnerable hit that becomes a full screen projectile use it as a reversal option or as a combo tool for extra damage it can combo off of almost any hit JP's level two super is easily his best and most interesting move in his kit JP summons four Fireballs the first hits mid the second hits overhead the third hits low and the fourth hits overhead Fireballs vanish if JP is hit as JP can move independently from the super it is possible to lock the opponent in a true block string forcing them to respect the mixup this is referred to as an unblockable by the community although with practice it is not hard to block as only specific routes Grant true block strings the opponent can also Drive reversal after the first Fireball on hit JP has a diverse set of options to create any favorable situation he wants he can go for damage a side switch resets corner carry and more this super will be explained in further detail in the pressure and setup sections of the guide for now please enjoy some combo [Music] [Music] examples JP's level three super is slow making it a bad wake up reversal option however it makes up for this by being full screen the super is incredibly easy to confirm off combos from anywhere on the [Music] screen the critical art version grants JP more damage than Oki and will always put JP full screen from the opponent
