all right so look it's time for the Lily guide but I hope you guys are doing well it's been a minute since I've uploaded but I'm about to upload a lot all right I literally enjoy Street Fighter 6 but we'll talk about that later let's get into this little guide so literally is an underused and underrated character right now you know not many people are really playing or talking about her you know I was actually the first master rank Lily and I'm still the only one right now of this video has this video so um she's great in the mid-range but also has like amazing Rush down and pressure um she's at her best when she has wind stocks you know obviously that's how she was designed so you want to give them as much as possible she has various ways she can get them on hidden block which I'll go over later in this video but you know first let's talk about uh her B and B so I'll show you some combos without the wind stocks um and I'll show you some with the wind stocks later on so her combos author when stocks aren't the greatest but they can always follow pretty much so stand line kicks and every punch or it's my best stand light kick stand light punch heavy DP right so you guys stand light punch twice heavy DP and then you got like Crouch light punch now this only works on standing so crowd slide punch three times and then heavy DP his kind of meaty and that's Universal it's not just like a Ryu thing or like a character specific thing I've tested on Lily because she's like the smallest character in the game right now and it even worked on Lily so unfortunately she doesn't have any like medium combos you know like um as you can see like this is like plus what plus one you know plus one right doesn't really have any medium combos but you can't like obviously like cancel like stand medium taking the like BP or like you know like low low forward to TP or like you know like Spire or something right but she doesn't really have like any like you know links from that and as far as heavy she doesn't really have like any heavy combos either for the most part I mean usually you'll just be doing like a single hit of a heavy into like a move so she does have like uh up close though she does have back heavy punch sound like heavy DP like this so that works that's cool it's like you know whatever right um and then as far as ex combos her ex combos are like very similar to like her media list combos that I showed that said you can kind of just you just end them inspire you can also get more lights so for example I could do like you know stand like it's normally wouldn't be able to do stand light kick and then stand uh light punch twice and then heavy DP right just won't connect but with the expire I could do that and it would work so I could do yeah expire see that's good it's kind of sucks because her like need those combos you can't end Inspire but at least you can do expire that's kind of you know two bars if you don't have the win clad stock but it gives you the knockdown that you get advantage and then we can talk about with the wind stocks so with the wind stocks you know we'll get let me just turn that on real quick this is a feature you can actually turn on in the game so if you didn't know you can know now you know you can just go to the character and turn on the win stocks so With the Wind stock you'll do like it's very like I said all her combos are very similar they're so simple so stand like kickstand light punch twice medium Spire right you got a stand light punch three times mediums Fire With the Wind stock on right yeah crowd tight punch three times and you guessed it medium spire really simple you know and um near the corner actually let's go near the corner so near the corner in the corner you know because the spiers kind of have a lot of corner carry you can do uh if you have two win stocks on you could do stuff like stand like kickstand light punch media Inspire DP you know you got stuff like that but uh we'll talk about with the win stacks on now so with win stack you could do like um heavy punch heavy punch drivers cancel heavy spire and then level one this does a lot of damage that's like almost 43 and you're plus 28 so if you dash you know you'll you'll still be plus you can get stuff um now with three you know I'm gonna give you guys bits because I'm gonna do a combo video after this is over so I'm gonna give you guys like bits and pieces okay uh so you could do like uh stand baby punch back heavy punch drivers cancel prosperous which with this particular combo before I finish it but with this particular combo you want to make sure that Crouch heavy punch hits and you cancel it early because you don't want the like when you do a Spire that's enhanced by enhanced by the wind um it's always three hits but with this combo you make the first hit of heavy Spire whiff and it allows you to do a medium Spire after that that's also enhanced and then you could do DP if you have the bar right so it'll look like this and then DP it looks crazy I know but you're making the first hit of heavy DP with or heavy Spire whip sorry and then it allows you to do the medium one which diversity of that hits and then the next two hits hit and then DP it looks crazy I don't know if it was intended or not but I figured it out so that's a really good punish counter combo and it's meatless so definitely write that one down in the books uh the next one we'll talk about is actually drive impact so drive impact you could do a few things so you would do driving pack Ninja Jump kick heavy heavy wind stack you know Condor wind um you could do now this one is going to be a little tough but this is how it goes so drive impact heavy kick medium medium DP so that one's gonna be a little tough but that's like the technically the best meatless combo she can do and then uh this next song I'm Gonna Do is actually with a wind stack on so one wins back so it looks like this driving pack mid screen again Mr jump kick back happy punch have these fire level one they're not bad not bad see not bad at all so that's really good so those that's like a those are some decent Drive Impact combos you know okay so I'm actually had to re-record this because this is a very important thing I forgot to add into the guide all right so this is going to be different from the other part of the video but just real quick it's very important to note that Lily's ex counter Aspire when you have a wind stock is projectile invincible so I'll show you real quick so if I had a Ryu Hadouken react in the E expire every time super easy super easy so you want to make sure you learn this and do it it's not hard worst case scenario is if they don't throw a fireball or you're buffering too hard you're plus two so keep that in mind so the next thing I want to actually talk about is Lily's pokes so her pokes are amazing to have like long range which the you know everybody knows that ain't gonna tell you that but the post you want to use are going to be like Stan medium punch Crouch heavy punch then heavy punch Crouch medium punch and stand heavy kick so stand stand medium punch is good for bullying people in neutral but be careful like doing it so many times in a row because it can make it susceptible to drive impact so you just you know this is a really good button like you just do this button you just kind of throw this out you can't cancel it or anything like that doesn't have like any special properties let me make sure I turn off like stuff like this but it doesn't have like any special like Properties or anything like that you just kind of just do it in neutral you annoy people right and then you know you could even do this they jump you can answer your DP right A lot of times so really good um you'll see in the summer matches actually that I'm gonna upload that's another thing I'm telling you guys a lot this is supposed to be a guy but you're going to see it later just take my word on it for now though it's really good for bullying people um sometimes you can actually drive impact back as well if they do the they do Drive Impact too late you know when you're like kind of throwing off stand medium punch now Crouch heavy punch is amazing it's arguably her best poke um but you know you can cancel into like uh Condor wind on block to give you a wind stack so it'll look like this you know you can do that um it's a really good antier if someone's jumping at you you know which let me see if I have that recorded so you really good anti-air and and you can even you know cancel the Spire like that even without the wind so it's really good anti air as you can see um so make sure you definitely use that and then um stand heavy punch is good because it's very similar to crotchet punch you could use it on block to get or hit to get like a win stack uh sometimes you'll even get like a random like punish kind of a neutral because someone just happened to throw out a button you just happened to throw yours out like raid as there's ended not even looking for it so it's really good just kind of Chunk this you know Chuck this in neutral and then you do that you know or you can even fake it you know there's a lot of things you could do with that one so make sure you use that one and then um let's see what else we got here we got Crouch medium punch so this is a this is a good poke too it's really good for like whip punishing you know like just with punishing um in general but you wanna you're really gonna be using this when you have like level one because you can cancel this into level one so you can't as you can see I'm doing the input right I can't cancel that anything else but level one you can like buffer this in neutral as soon as you see the hit just press punch and then Super just comes out so you're like okay play neutral cross medial punch level one and then of course that's almost 80 but then of course you get a free win stock so that's really good and then last but definitely not least is Stan heavy kick so it's a great poke because it has like a lot of pushback and it's great for space traps so I'm gonna give you an example of what I'm talking about when I say that it's great for space traps so I'll do I'll have them set to do standing here punch so even Point Blank right so this move is minus five by the way but Point Blank so you're pretty much safe if you space it out because four frames in this game is the fastest so same empty kick right oops not bad in that one box see I'm messing up this is my first time so it could be some slight all right first time I'm gonna guide so send it to kick right and then say many punch comes out so see that and you hit them you know it's really good I know I got a win stegos let me turn it off but you get the point oops so he got hit there right um that's really good but you get the you get the point you can just make people like whip stuff and just hit them so I usually do like craft crowds heavy punch too and that works so really good really good you can get the idea of the space that you can get from it so those are like pretty much our best pokes as of right now uh maybe more you know I'll probably do like a complete guide eventually this is just supposed to be like a quicker guide so let's go to like the pressure so Lily's pressure is good with and without Stacks you know when stocks due to her RPS or rock paper scissors game right it does greatly increase with wind Stacks though so her pressure is like chain of Lights just like everybody else in this game right you chain lights for your pressure so you're gonna be doing stuff like uh you know like stand light kick crash light punch twice or even stand light punch twice stand light punch shows more damage so you might just do stand light punch and it changed into it and then obviously if someone's mashing you know uh they'll get hit right so it'll look like and they do like level one like that because they were caught mashing at any point so even though it's technically fake you can tick throw with command grab or regular throw you know once you condition your opponent enough with like the chain lights so you can so you condition your them to block by confirming your lights into a full combo like you just saw right you just saw it like I just did that so and uh from that you can get like a free win stock as well which you saw and you know obviously your the win stock if you don't know when you have the wind so I can do spider on block up close is plus one so you're you're plus one and everybody knows that after either immediately or after playing you right so that means that they eventually will respect you because you're plus one so you don't have to press the button so then that's when you do stuff like command grab right there even though it's technically fake you're only plus one you need to be plus two to do that or you could do a stand light kick and to grab because they think you're gonna chain the Jabs anyone get hit with super you can see how the RPS is working there so then you can kind of just repeat the sequence like over and over like honestly you could just confirm the light through the wins the get the wind and then go in with the Spire stand light kick you know chain the lights to try to jump again think of the grabs coming right or you could just Spire grab get the win stock repeat you can see how it works like you just it's always it's looping offense Lily has uh looping often so um you can just you get how it goes so one thing I will say though is um if you think someone's gonna press a button because some people don't they don't care they just don't know so they'll always Mash after blocking the Spire if you do the win stock and then you do um light spot or the expire your plus two so if like I'll show you where you um blocking and then doing um stand light punch on block right and then I'll grab them you see that it said counter hit because you tried to press a button on plus two command grabs five frame startup frame trap can't press anything right so uh one more thing I want to show you real quick as far as like uh the pressure goes is Lily has like a really cheap setup at the land of command grab so if you have a wind stock on right which you'll get after Atlanta command grab anyway you do command grab the thing you do you expire and you're plus eight so basically what this means is if someone tries to jump or press a button or whatever they'll get hit right so you could you could also if they respect you because it's plus eight it looks plus to most people you can get another command grab then get a win stock or you could do like um just Crouch fears and then you know get like a win soccer hit them right so it could look like this so you do the win right you can't get a win you expire grab again winstock and then voila and you can just kind of repeat getting in right but it's crazy because if you have three win stocks you can technically throw Loop so you could command grab somebody right how to respire oops I'm bad messed up I did the wrong thing so command grab the expire command grab again right the expire you may grab again he expire and then command grab again so you can technically throw Loop if if the if you could think the person will respect it and obviously you know third Loops aren't really in this game but Lily got it with that so it's really cool so yeah the next thing I want to talk about though is defense well actually hold on before we talk about the fence I actually want to add that um they can't even drive impact this back they cannot drive impact this back so let's say um you know they they were to wake up and then do drive impact where's this at there to wake up and do driving a pack uh all right Aspire I land and then I could do my combo after this right we're not gonna do it because you get the point but yeah but it does lose to wake up supers wake up ex reversals and perfect Perry so you have to be careful about that but yeah that's a really good setup I don't even really like that one if you didn't know about it so the last thing we'll go over is the fence so outside of universal mechanics really doesn't have like a fully Invincible reversal you know hurry XDP is throwing vulnerable and is anti-air vulnerable so um if someone tries to throw you or neutral jump on your wake up then that's when you would do like exp right some people are like oh why do you do that is it's not fully Invincible but if you have to read on like somebody trying to grab you then yeah that's why um but you do have the level one super you know this right here this is good so you can wake up with that um to get the opponents off you only feel like they're being too aggressive so and that pretty much honestly wraps up the Lily guide all right this is the first time I ever did it so you guys gotta let me know how I did I know I had a little bit of mistakes probably in here but hey it is what it is you know as long as you guys get the the point and you get the purpose of this that's all that matters all right I'm even gonna time stamp this so you can go to each individual part if you want to come back and revisit you're like oh what part of the video right I'll do that and um you know if you guys want to follow me on Twitch you can follow
