what's going on everyone this is dark synth and this is a project I have been working on for a while quite some time I started writing the script for this around two months ago I've just been putting it off um due to personal issues but I'm finally glad to be getting around to getting this out it's something I've been wanting to do ever since I saw Broski uh do his aie guide and just saw how in-depth he did it so I'm like hey maybe I could do that for Ryu um since he's my main I know a lot about the character and I want to teach those that like don't know how to play Ryu how to play him cuz he's a really cool character and really fun um but yeah without further Ado um we're just going to get onto the video so why should you play Ryu Ryu is a very straightforward and simple character to understand his game plan consists of forcing his opponent to make mistakes through his Fireball game and can do big damage if the opponent makes one crucial mistake rler should be enough to play him he's a monk traveling the world to fight stronger opponents I picked him up because of this is very much me trying to improve in season 1 Ryu was considered kind of weak but now that season 2 has rolled around Ryu is very dangerous now in season 2 Ryu got his light hash geki buffed making it minus three on block previously minus four he can also now throw light and medium Fireballs without the cost of using Denon and his ex Denon hasho damage scaling got buffed so now it no longer scales as hard in Combos and finally crouching medium kick now also combos into Denon hasho meterless well now that we're on the topic of dungeon let's talk about it dungeon charge Powers Reeves haseki and Fireball up this is a vital part of ryu's tool set to help fight the fireball War especially against characters like guile ex HHO while charged will crumple the opponent and allow Ryu to follow up for a combo reuse Fireball does increase damage and is launched faster regular Fireball does 600 damage and Denon does 800 ex dungeon does 1,000 re's Drive Rush is pretty mediocre compared to characters like jury bison and Camy however it's still good to use to mix in your approach and neutral so don't neglect it you're going to use this drive rush in neutral once you get your opponent conditioned with fireballs in normals if your opponent keeps checking your drive rush you can bait them out with a medium kick or heavy kick donkey kick or even a heavy punch hash geki heavy punch hasho is great at baiting out delay techs as it reels Ryu back and if they don't Tech and block you're now plus two standing light punch is re's for frame and longest reaching light punch it can chain into crouching light kick and back into itself or crouching light punch this will be ryu's way of pressuring using a crouching light kick will catch an opponent trying to walk back after a blocked Jab on counter hit standing light punch will link into standing medium Punch or crouching medium punch and standing light kick one thing to note is Ryu cannot link into a standing light kick from Jabs without a counter hit during Drive Rush standing light punch can link into back heavy punch for optimal damage it can also link into back heavy punch from punish counter crutching light punch is also four frames and has less reach than reused standing light punch this however will be your checking button to interrupt fake pressure or just to fuzzy jab their shimmy on counter hit this also links into standing medium punch and crouching medium punch for an easy conversion same as standing light punch crouching light punch will link into both medium punches during Drive Rush and will also link into back heavy punch one thing to note is crouching light punch has less push back than standing light punch on block standing light kick is five frames and reuse furthest reaching light normal this will be used to prod your opponent to get them to preemptively poke at you so you can set up with punishes and to punish moves that are minus5 on hit this will cancel into light donkey kick on counter hit and punish counter this will cancel into ex donkey kick standing medium punch will link from a counter hit standing light kick canceled into a drive Rush cancelling into a fireball can create a spacing trap however this loses the DI so be careful you can make this safe by cancelling into ex Fireball crutching light kick has pretty good range for a light button and is also five frames it will catch players walking back when trying to shimmy allowing you to steal your turn it's not special or drive Rush cancellable this will mainly be used to chain your lights together for pressure on counter hit this will link into standing light kick on Drive Rush this will link into standing medium Punch or crouching medium punch reuse jumping light punch has a pretty downward hit box which is good for air to airs when your opponent is trying to cross you up you can also use this as a fuzzy guard but only use this to close out rounds jumping light kick is one of Reus cross-up tools if he's a little too far from the opponent this doesn't have a downward hit box like jumping light punch so don't use this for air to airs now on to ryu's mediums both of ryu's medium punches are six frame startup standing medium punch is minus one un block so be careful trying to keep pressuring after this is blocked Drive Rush standing medium punch is plus three on block and can frame trap into itself or crouching medium punch a light or medium Fireball will frame trap anyone trying to take their turn back with a jab this links into crouching medium punch and back heavy punch on regular hit only issue with back heavy punch is you need to be point blank or it'll whiff on counter hit this will link into crouching heavy punch for optimal damage if you're slightly out of range for crouching heavy punch you can confirm into a sweep or crouching medium kick it also links into standing heavy punch on punish counter it sort of has a disjointed hit box so it hits slightly further than what it seems like standing medium punch also goes into a Target combo of light kick heavy kick which can also be cancelled into dungeon charge this is is useful for confirming after a solar plexus crutching medium punch is reused furthest reaching medium punch and is a good withd Punisher this will frame trap into medium punch hasho but be careful if they don't press you're minus 6 on block this is zero making it plus4 on Drive Rush on hit this links into a standing light kick and on counter hit this links into a standing medium punch and back heavy punch this will link into crouching heavy punch from Drive Rush from Drive Rush cancel this will link and standing heavy punch as well as standing heavy kick this during Drive rush and standing heavy punch will be your go-to di block stun button if the opponent tries jumping out they will get hit due to the block stun value being high Ford medium punch is Reus overhead and is 20 frames startup it's plus three on hit and minus one on block so you don't get much without Drive Rush this will mainly be used after Drive rush so that you can get a combo off it in season two they buffed this so that Ryu can now link into back heavy punch if they're crouching standing medium kick is ninef frame startup and probably the slowest standing medium kick however it has good range and slightly moves Ryu forward it's minus four on block but has good push back leaving Ryu at a range to ba a Whi on counter hit this will link into crouching medium Punch If close enough on punish counter this will link into crouching medium kick as well as level one you can perfect Parry trap with this if your opponent takes their turn back with a normal right away Ryu has a slower crouching medium kick at 8 frames compared to Ken's seven frames crouching medium kick but reuse has a slightly better Reach This will be one of ryu's main poking tools in the season 2.5 balance patch reuse crouching medium kick into Fireball is now a true block string on Drive Rush cancell this Lings into standing heavy punch and crouching heavy punch on Drive Rush hit this will link into standing light kick this will be good at catching your opponent holding back on wake up reuse jumping medium punch this is strictly for air to airs on hit this will juggle the opponent allowing Ryu to cancel into a Tatsu for Corner carry immediate jump medium punch you only get a Tatsu cancel or a DP a delayed medium punch will allow Ryu to juggle with back heavy kick into ex donkey kick cancel or a super if spaced out and they try jumping out of the corner you can air to a them into ex Tatsu and spend level one or level three for a conversion you might have to delay the air ex Tatsu cancel if spaced out otherwise level three won't land jumping medium kick will be ryu's main crossup tool if blocked at Peak height this leaves Ryu plus five however if he makes it deep he's plus eight this is useful for if you land a hit as you can link into crouching heavy punch from a deep jump in medium kick at Peak height you will have to go into standing or crouching medium punch standing heavy punch is probably re's best poke aside from Fireball like standing medium kick it moves him forward and is only minus two on block the Drive Chip is also important as it takes away half a bar cancelling into medium kick donkey kick is a true block string and takes away a whole bar if blocked at max range you can set up a spacing trap and wh punish your opponent for big damage on hit it's plus four which can link into jab on counter hit it's plus six and on punish counter it's plus eight which links into crouching medium kick and it'll cancel into heavy punch hasho and combo this can also be hit confirmed into drive rush or any special on Drive Rush cancel you can link into standing heavy kick on Drive Rush hit you can link into back heavy Punch If blocked during Drive Rush is plus two this also goes into a Target combo of heavy kick which can be canceled into dungeon some tech I found from Paladin who is one of the best Ryu players in North America if your opponent tries walking out of range after two lights you can jail them with the target combo which is minus 6 on block but what this does is create a spacing trap so you can with punish crouching heavy punch is a great antier to use in earlier ranks other than being a great anti-air this will be reused best Drive Chip normal and used in combos I mentioned standing heavy punch does half a bar of Drive Chip but crouching heavy punch takes a quarter of a bar away use this instead in combos this will be used used to confirm into heavy punch hasho for bread and butter combos Ford heavy punch is reused solar plexus and it's been as staple move since forever from Street Fighter 5 it's got buffed at plus three on block which standing medium punch and crouching medium punch can frame trap if blocked at a distance players will sometimes like to hold back to walk out of range of your followup if they do this you can catch them with a crouching medium kick it does have a bar of Drive Chip just like standing heavy punch it's not drive rush or special cancellable it's plus six on hit plus eight on counter hit and plus 10 on punish counter in the rare occasion you get a punish counter you can link into crouching heavy Punch or standing heavy punch for Max damage which I just showed some players that like to use di after plus frames you can bait out and punish them if you have level two or three back heavy punch is seven frame startup and minus 13 on block on hit this can cancel into heavy kick donkey kick on counter hit this will link into heavy punch has the only time you'll be using this normal is to confirm into heavy kick donkey kick and to frame trap delayed buttons as you can see reuse plus 15 after the trade so he can link into standing heavy punch and confirm into a drive rush or EX donkey kick combo however this can frame trap into ex hasho outside of that this normal isn't good in Block string pressure standing heavy kick will be your go-to link during Drive Rush combos it's also Reus main punish counter normal for punishing reversals outside of driver Rush combos this is a great anti-air if your opponent jumps at you from a slightly further distance if you happen to counter hit them with this you can link into level one a good way to set this up is to be three4 or full screen away and throw a light Fireball if they jump the last second you can drive rush and catch them coming down Ryu sweep is probably one of the best in the game it's nine frames and has very good range he gets a really nice Oki setup off a punish counter sweep immediately back dash into drive Rush standing heavy punch and you'll be plus six on block throwing a sweep out after hitting an opponent with a fireball isn't actually a bad idea as a lot of players like to try and take their turn when getting hit so this will catch them trying to walk forward or press buttons reuse forward heavy kick has pretty decent range and much like standing medium kick and standing heavy punch it moves Ryu forward quite a bit if spaced out right it can create a spacing trap be careful though because this move has a lot of recovery of whiffed the great part about this move though is it's hit confirmable it can cancel into regular and ex Tatsu midscreen Ryu gets a free dungeon charge after ex Tatsu in the corner he gets a heavy punch DP into level three if your opponent likes to delay Tech during Drive Rush cancels this will put Ryu Airborne dodging the throw and counter hitting the opponent this is plus eight and can link into back heavy punch another good thing about this move is it goes over low so if you time your opponent's attacks right you can counter hit them for trying to walk up and poke with Crouch medium kick back heavy kick is a 10f frame double hitting normal that is minus four on block but leaves Ryu spaced out enough to not be punished it's really easy to hit confirm since it is double hitting much like solar plexus however this is going to be used mainly during Reus juggle combos in season two this did get buffed and now ground bounces after an ex donkey kick which I just showed and during Drive Rush juggles this can also be used to try and sneak in drive impact in the corner instead of letting both Hits come out you can cancel into di on the first so use it at your own discretion in Balance patch 2.5 re you gains more meter off this normal mou so just some general tips about uh reuse Fireball game so reuse Fireball is going to be his main tool that he's going to use to get information uh out of his opponent the whole point of reuse Fireball game is to counter pooke them or get them to react so you can punish them I.E a jump or a slow uh Fireball invulnerable move so starting with reuse light punch Fireball it's 16 frame startup uh being the slowest however one of the best versions there's multiple ways of using light punch Fireball you can trap them if they block a light punch Fireball into a heavy punch Fireball around midscreen this is also effective on knockdown throw a light punch Fireball after a heavy punch DP and if they try to wake up jump you can catch them R you can also throw a light punch Fireball and follow behind it with a drive rush you can either try to frame trap them or throw them if they try to Parry when used in a block string such as standing heavy punch you can create a spacing trap and something to keep in mind is the faster versions of Fireball make you more minus light punch leaves you at the most Advantage medium punch Fireball is 14 frame startup and slightly faster it's good to mix in to try and catch players walking forward and trying to poke if blocked at mid-range it has 15 frames of recovery whereas heavy punch Fireball has 20 frames of recovery so if you want a fireball trap make sure to use light punch first it's still good to mix in medium punch Fireball to change the timing up so your opponent doesn't get any perfect paring heavy punch Fireball is 12 frame startup but has the most recovery if blocked or hit at Mid to close range using heavy punch Fireball up close is useful as it is the fastest and can clip the opponent often however it seems to be a little more effective just outside of mid-range because you can still catch your opponent if they jump late so ex Fireball is uh most effectively used during the fireball War if you know your opponent is going to throw a regular nonex projectile and you want to challenge to try and land a knockdown ex Fireball is best used this way if you and your opponent's meter are about even the best thing to do is to wait for them to use their ex first because they now have to worry about being burnt out so while you're zoning them you're gaining meter back and when you do throw that ex Fireball you'll have more meter left over than your opponent if you time it right you can link it into level one from a ex Fireball so some good advice on using Fireballs is to not be predictable and one way of doing that is to get your opponent used to a specific range that you throw your Fireballs at then get into that range and don't throw any Fireballs at all use Jabs to fake them out and get them to jump another way is to throw out a specific amount of fireballs throw two to three at Max then start throwing just one and see how your opponent reacts these are really good ways to bait out your opponent and like I said mix up your Fireball speeds to avoid your opponent perfect pairing them and getting a knockdown on you all Fireball versions do the same damage except for ex so regular does 600 ex does 800 to uh 200 damage more with Denon being added it does an additional 200 damage for a total of 1,000 damage light punch hasho recently got buffed in season 2 and is now minus 3 three on block which is safe this will be your special to cancel into if your opponent likes to try and check you after three lights on counter hit you can react with a drive rush into standing or crouching medium punch into medium kick Tatsu to convert light punch hasho can also be used in a way to bait the opponent to Parry your Fireballs then drive rush in and throw them for a punish counter and also since it's minus three on block you can perfect Parry bait if your opponent likes to take their turn back with the normal medium punch hasho will mainly be used to confirm into a combo and leave the opponent standing for a strike throw mixup this can also be used if you don't want to mess up the heavy punch into level three cancel you sacrifice some damage but it still does quite a bit of damage this will frame trap from Crouching medium punch if your opponent likes to take their turn back after zero unblock just be careful though as medium punch hasho is minus 6 heavy punch hasho is 30 frames on Startup so this is very reactable to Di and perfect Parry however it has a Juggle property have landed in a combo the best way to combo into this is from a drive Rush cancel into crouching heavy punch heavy punch hasha will be used in a lot of reused juggles to get that extra Corner carry and for some meter efficient combos on block this is plus two and leaves Ryu close enough for a strike throw mixup ex hasho is great to use in Block string pressure combine this with crouching heavy punch and you take away one and a qu bar from your opponent and leaves you plus three this allows Ryu to frame trap with a medium punch and go for light block string pressure or a throw mixup this is also good to confirm into level two or three if you're trying to close rounds out if you notice you have a significant Drive lead against your opponent use this to burn them out crouching heavy punch into ex HHO is a true block string so abuse this back heavy punch into ex HHO is a frame trap and if you counter hit with ex hasho you can confirm into two Jabs into DP or Tatsu with the most recent patch EXO's damage went from 900 to 1100 so so catching your opponent with something safe like crouching medium kick ex HHO level two will slightly do more damage now like kick Tatsu is mainly used to end your combos this will leave your opponent the closest to you and leaves you with a strike throw mixup after a single Dash medium kick Tatsu will mainly be used for Corner carry so that way Ryu can run his Corner pressure earlier heavy kick Tatsu has two great uses one is to get out of the corner since it side switches the other use is if you react to a fireball at mid-range you can clip your opponent this is great against Aki and other Fireball characters ex Tatsu is mainly reused corner combo extender he can go into a drive Rush standing medium punch crouching medium punch or just ending heavy punch DP for a meterless followup so before I get into DPS one thing I want to mention is if you play a character with the DP you need to learn how to Crosscut this will anti-air players that are trying to cross you up or jump out of the corner the way I like to do it is to hold forward as my oppon opponent is jumping over me then do a quarter Circle back but end in down forward so that way you don't get a super instead of a DP another way of doing it is to just do the DP motion like normal but slightly delay the punch button so it auto corrects the light version of DP is best used as an anti-air yes heavy punch does do more damage but with a light punch DP you will get better oky and have less of a chance of going under the opponent and whiffing medium punch is the less used version of DP only in the corner after heavy kick donkey kick if you know your DP won't whiff on your jumping opponent then heavy punch DP is the best version for damage you will also use this in combos for optimal damage into level three knowing the difference in damage between light punch and heavy punch DP can mean you leave your opponent with a few HP left or koing them perfect KO like I just mentioned if you know your light Punch or heavy punch DP won't KO on your opponent's predictable end of round jump or in a combo then spend your your meter to ensure you get the KO perfect KO reuse level one is great at closing out rounds if you don't have to spend level two or three if you know you can burn your opponent out from it in a combo definitely go for it even if it doesn't kill you can also react to your ex Fireball hitting your opponent in the fireball war and convert into level one for that extra health and drive damage while Denon charged Ryu gets 400 extra damage however Denon only improves the damage output and not the speed level two super is unique as it has three different levels of charge there's immediate slightly delayed and fully charged you can tell when it's charged partway when it does a little spark sound effect this does 100 more damage than the immediate charge you can combo into this from Crouching heavy punch and back heavy punch this is good to know if you need to close a round out [Applause] KO Ryu can get a fully charged hit from this after cancelling ex donkey kick KO putting crouching heavy punch and ex hasho together along with level two is a great way of chipping your opponent to close out rounds and even matches KO that way if you have three bars you'll enter round two or round three with a bar of super and potentially get another level two it's important to pay attention to both yours and your opponent's Drive meter during the match level three will be ryu's main damage Ender to close out rounds in matches or to even burn his opponent out or recover meter of his own own it's better to treat Drive meter in this game as your primary health bar if you get burnt out your chances of winning go down significantly so even spending level three to get that slight drive and health lead is crucial I'll show you some optimal damaging combos later that involve level three [Music] I [Applause] I you e d a for [Music] you up [Music] you Dam [Applause] [Music] you you [Music] you you [Music] you you you MO so now that we've gone over some combos I just want to go over some safe jumps that Ryu gets he only gets one safe jump mid screen and it's after his ex donkey kick the rest of them are in the corner so I'll show you the one mid screen and we're plus 10 so one of them is off of a light kick donkey kick so you do immediate jump you kind of have to time the punch a little bit late here but you are plus 11 the next one is after ex Tatsu you want to do light punch hasho so there is one re gets from midscreen to Corner uh you have to make sure your opponent lands in the corner though to get it so how you do it is off of of EX donkey kick and it kind of involves a drive Rush juggle and I'll show you what I mean so there I'm plus 11 and then I'll set Ken to do wake up DP so you have to do Drive rush and do immediate standing medium punch and then for heav kick into meteor list Tatu and you get your safe jump and the next one is in the corner after an ex dungon haho um what you do is you slightly delay a Ford kick or he Ford heavy kick into Tatu okay so now that we got his main safe jumps out of the way uh we can just go into regular ok now so after light Tatsu Ryu can get an instant Dash into light punch hasho and this will leave him plus three what are you waiting for so it leaves you plus two I thought it was plus three that's still enough for a light chain frame trap or a throw you can also will go into Ford heavy punch instead of just the Haso and then that'll leave you plus three so say you happen to punish counter sweep your opponent you see them with a crouching medium kick and then you punish them with the sweep um this makes it to where they can't back roll and it leaves this Oki setup so what you want to do is after the punish counter sweep you back dash immediately and then you drive rush into immediate standing heavy punch and this should leave you plus 5 to plus 6 so there I messed it up the first time but plus six and if it happens to land on hit so if you happen to land the standing heavy punch on hit you can link into standing heavy kick so so for a fireball mey setup what you want to do is end your combo in medium kick Tatsu and as soon as you recover your you throw your light punch Fireball it's better if you land a little closer to the uh corner so it's in even better if you're in the corner it leaves you plus n on hit and then if they decide to block it leaves you plus three so you can frame trap with the medium punch after and this is very useful against JP so make sure you learn this Fireball setup another meaty Fireball setup you can do is after ex Tatsu you end in light kick donkey kick this will also leave you plus three on block Ryu has pretty decent burnout pressure that can slowly push his opponent to the corner what you're going to want to do is Loop crouching light punch into light punch hasho after three crouching light punch and light punch hos you can do standing light punch and a drive rush to continue the pressure with the standing heavy punch and drive impact the opponent has only one frame Gap to react with super to avoid getting stunned if your opponent's trying to walk back or just standing up you only get two crouching light punches into hasho so in that case you want to use standing light punch for the third hit into drive Rush one thing you can do to be less predictable about your di block string is you can do standing heavy punch and and not cancel but then go into di right after be careful throwing to many Fireballs as Aki can react with a venomous F use standing heavy kick to go through her poison ball the first few hits of cruel fate can be ducked and died standing heavy punch into poison bubble into whip cancel can be punished by going into instant Drive rush to avoid chip from level two and are about midscreen Ryu can instant air Tatsu to completely avoid the super and punish Aki so another way to punish ai's level two is to either block or just parry and then before the final hit comes out you want to drive rush and if you do it right you'll avoid it and then you can drive Rush In And punish your guaranteed okay I messed up the link but you saw there if you parry it actually reduces the push back so you're a lot closer and you also just gain meter but yeah you get to just to reliably punish akuma's air Fireball use heavy punch DP this is ryu's best option as if Akuma chooses to jump without an air Fireball Ryu will still land in here back heavy kick can punish demon flip and net you with small combo Akuma standing heavy kick is a twoh hitting normal that ends in a high Ryu can react and punish with a crouching heavy Punch If Akuma does wake up level one in the corner you can react to the screen freeze and neutral jump netting him a free dungeon charge into a guaranteed punish if Akuma does wake up level one in the corner Ryu can react to the screen freeze and neutral jump netting him a free dine charge into a guaranteed punish [Music] ryuken punished Blanca's Ford heavy punch with level one Blanca's down forward heavy punch even at tip range is still very punishable with the crouching medium kick standing heavy punch into hop on block can be interrupted and converted into a counter hit combo Rainbow Ball can be punished with either standing heavy kick or back heavy kick and allows Ryu for a small combo cammy's medium and heavy spinning back fist can be baited by reuse fireballs use crouching medium punch to interrupt Cammy has very good air control with her dive kick and can be even Plus on block if spaced right use DP or back dash to reliably shut this down if Cammy tries using hooligan you can easily jabber out of it and go for a Juggle [Music] combo try to avoid using Fireballs when Cammy has level three as she can react and punish lock on one way to bait this out is by ending a combo and donkey kick or light punch DP and throwing out a fireball this will make the Camy player think they can punish your recovery frames or you can try to bait it out with a light punch Haso chenle's medium Huzan shu is fairly fast and is her anti- projectile tool you can interrupt with a medium punch and if timed right will'll leave her standing you can also go for a Juggle if interrupted with the light ex aanu is faster but is minus five on block at all ranges Ryu can punish with standing light kick on punish counter standing light kick and crouching light kick can link into crouching medium Punch If close enough Ryu can link into back heavy punch from punish counter crouching light kick Chanley has a wall jump and players will use it to try and escape the corner use jump back medium punch to catch them if timed right you can land and use a level one ryuk can punish DJ's heavy Fireball with heavy Tatsu this is risky as DJ can fake with light Fireball visually react to the Fireballs a lot of DJ players like to use knee shot as a jump in for pressure use Dragon punch to Reliable shut this down with Do's limbs being very long Ryu can wh punish with standing and crouching heavy punch into level one if Sim charges his Fireball Ryu gets a free dungeon charge your ex Fireball into level one confirm Sim players like to do yoga Arch into slide to try and cover all sections of the screen you can drive impact this just be careful as a smart dolum player will bait this out with Sim's drill being very oppressive up close use ryu's DP to reliably shut it down you can also back dash to punish his wake up level two in the corner slightly delay a drive impact depending on how many resources you have you can ex DP through the last hit of the super or super back flicker is one of Ed's best tools to use in neutral however if Ryu catches Ed charging the light version he can react with a heavy Tatsu or ex Fireball into level one both of these will even catch Ed if he tries to back dash cancel Drive Impact will also work but only if Ed commits to letting go light punch Blitz is minus five on block you can punish this with standing light kick Ed's throw in the corner is very good as he can use a perfectly time charged light punch flicker the only way to beat this option is to perfect Parry however Ed can Dash cancel his Flicker and throw you for parrying Ed's jumping medium kick has a great angle at which can be hard for Ryu to antiair with a DP instead to use standing heavy kick medium and heavy headbutt can be reacted to with a perfect Parry however Honda can bait it out with a light head butt and throw your whiffed Parry to counter this buffer a drive Rush option select and punish with a light punch safe jumps typically don't work against Honda due to his armor safe jumps typically don't work against Honda due to his armor to counter his wake up ex headbutt use a light kick instead Sumo Slam can be very obnoxious to deal with three ways to deal with this is to perfect Parry jump medium Punch or just Dragon punch the thing about hondaa Sumo Slam is the hitbox isn't active until he's actually going down guile zoning can be very oppressive it's best to perfect parry and drive rush in to stay on him you can react to Guile's heavy Punch Sonic Blade startup and punish with a sweep at further distances you can do Drive rush into sweep ex Fireball will beat Guile's nonex version of Sonic blades followup just be careful on spending too much meter against guile as you'll just burn yourself out if JP gets too overzealous with a zoning Ryu can heavy Tatsu from full screen and land a heavy punch DP after JP can bait this out with a fake Minion so be careful with your reads perfect Parry JP's minions to help get in one tip against JP is to not wake up backwards after a knockdown as this will just put yourself in the corner even more JP's defense against meaty Fireballs is lackluster it's important to set these up when taking him to the corner as it will outright beat Amnesia and can convert into a big combo [Music] the only counter JP has to mey Fireball setups is the perfect parry and level three reuse Ford heavy kick can go over jury's Fireball and score a knockdown jury players will like to jump reuse fireballs and punish with a dive kick which gives jury insane Corner carry you can try to bait it out in anti-air or just block it since it's never safe J's medium kick fua is minus 6 on block however she can space this out to make a spacing trap if she miss spaces this you can punish with a standing light kick Ken standing heavy kick is minus five on block but we can space it out to be safe heavy Dragon lash is plus one on block standing and plus two crouching it has very slow startup and you can interrupt it with the standing medium punch and juggle laughter you can also react with a drive impact or perfect Parry gin can be a complicated move if you don't know how to deal with it heavy Genry is very slow and reactable with a perfect Parry the light followup is a true block string but is minus five use standing light kick to punish standing or crouching heavy punch into a medium kick Genry is a true block string but even if Ken decides to not do a followup you can punish with an ex reversal or a super against Ken's Fireball game make sure you perfect Parry his fireballs and drive rush or instant jump in Kimberly standing heavy punch and to run is a fake block string and can be reversal through if she tries to do standing medium kick into run you can interrupt her with a jab Kimberly's raw teleport is very risky for her to do the moment you see her smoke appear press standing heavy kick if she does the grounded teleport you will get a full punish counter combo if she does ex teleport Ryu can still juggle her and get a level one after for a little extra damage if spaced out you can react to ex Condor Spire with drive impact when slly gains wind Stacks it's best not to throw Fireballs if you happen to block Lily's level two on wake up Ryu can get a dungeon charge punish Marissa's charge Gladius has has armor but is vulnerable to Lowe's if you catch her charging it in neutral you can punish her with the crouching medium kick or sweep the regular version of Marissa's Superman punch is very slow with the light version being 25 frames you can react with the normal and juggle her or use Drive Impact just be careful reacting to ex Superman punch with Drive In impact as it will armor break heavy punch DP here is your best option if Marissa does wake up level one a safe jump will not activate the freeze frame allowing you to neutral jump and Dodge her [Music] attack if bison Miss spaces his light in medium scissors Ryu can punish with the standing light kick into ex donkey kick standing medium punch into Ford heavy Punch or down heavy kick is a fake Target combo and can be parried bison can bait this out with just a standing medium punch and throw you if bison tries to do Shadow rise into Devil's reverse you can jump at him and air to air him with medium punch be careful as bison can bait out any anti-air attempt by doing an early head press in the case that bison tries to cross you up to make your DP wh just slightly delay your DP as he crosses back over you some players will like to put a bomb on you and go for an immediate psycho Crusher you can de die this if bison uses Ex Psycho Crusher this will lose in that case use a super art bison ending in back fist combo into a mey throw sets up for a perfect standing medium punch overhead low in the next interaction Parry this my non-standing heavy kick is minus 6 on block but if spaced out can be safe use standing light kick if she miss spaces it be careful as she can use this as a spacing trap on whiff however this move is super punishable at 26 frames of recovery it's such a a slow recovering move that Ryu can react with solar plexus and net big damage quarter Circle back heavy kick is 20 frame startup but has a ton of recovery after a successful command grab Menon can space it out you can try to react with either a perfect Parry or drive impact even if you react a little late with Drive Impact manone cannot di back just like Lily and Akuma Ryu can get a dungeon charge punish on manon's level two [Music] ex spinning mixer no longer gets oky as in the latest patch Capcom increased the recovery of it if he tries Drive rushing after you can check him with crutching medium punch you can choose to not wake up backward and if he tries to level two you can super art him or just use e DP if you ex DP the damage difference is 760 HP which I think is a pretty good trade depending on your health state if Rashi tries doing raw level two

just be careful if rashed goes into medium or ex Cyclone these frame trap light or medium Cyclone into back kick followup is very fake and you can interrupt with a normal even on hit ryu's heavy kick
