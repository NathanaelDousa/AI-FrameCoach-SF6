yo yo yo what is up YouTube it's your boy Jen and I'm back with another video make sure to pronounce that name right it's Zen gen and um I want to teach you guys how to use DJ because y'all DJs are way too trash and not making it top eight so yeah basically the only DJs I can watch is fudo probably some few Japanese DJ and hot dog but uh yeah I don't see the reason why DJs are not making too much progress in this game because he is so broken to be honest but yeah I'll teach you guys how to use him so make sure to comment subscribe and click the like I guess so I want to first talk about the fireball first you have the fame the light one is the fame and it could be quite useful sometimes but you you know when you do this you lose all your charge sometimes I rather do this than the thing because when they see this they might want to jump as well because they think it's the heavy Fireball you know because you can actually react to the heavy Fireball and you can jump on that but yeah you can keep the charge when you do this if they jump they can do this but the faint you can also enter your here but it just yeah just use it randomly I guess and one thing to notice about the heavy Fireball is that when they actually like walk okay a little far you can't uh so your carrots are kind of moved back a little bit so yeah just make sure to not use happy Fireball too much because they can jump on it but it is quite useful when you use it the right time and it's also very important to know that sometimes your drive gauge is not very good you use this you can get like half of your D drive gauge back so that is pretty good you can also do the medium one which is you only minus five after that you basically is safe so or you can't even do the thing but this is like minus5 one thing to know is that when you do the medium Fireball you can charge almost immediately and if you're charging fast enough you can do this so yeah this is pretty good because some people might not know and they might jump on that but this is actually safe to throw heavy Fireball and do this make sure your range is correct I guess so let's talk about his normals uh standing light punch is four frame crouching is five frame and you need to know that sometimes when you do a combo let's say you get like punish counter you can do this combo because it's like plus five after the standing heavy punch you can combo into to crouch light punch but sometimes it's probably too close and see oh this is five frame but like this three frame yeah that's too close but sometimes you only get plus four after this but and you have to do this this is actually uh you can charge and Press light punch and do the up movement right after yeah I think a lot of people don't know how to use this because if you're like plus four you can only do this combo which is not good you do you do this combo you you get like really good Corner carry and damage is good too so just make sure you know how to do this because I I don't see no DJ doing it but yeah most of the situation you can do Crouch so it's pretty easy to do this and so you need to know that this button is broken very broken it's only eight frame and you can Crouch when doing this so even if you whiff the jump you can do the flash kick so just press this [ __ ] all the time and like sometimes when you're like when they're like they want to combo but they're not close enough just okay kind of do this you know like even when you get hit you just press this button all the time and it works I promise just combo after that very easy and you you will be surprised how easy it is to win with this character and this one this is really good button because this is plus two on block you can cancel into this stuff uh you can actually do it slowly you can do it as slow as you want or as fast as you want but it kind of makes it not that easy to perfect power that and yeah there's also a Target combo this one would sometimes you don't have meter let's say this kind of situation you can actually get a lot of meter from doing this let me show you um wait okay just notice how much meter I get the last it you almost get like two heavy punch meter so that is pretty good and also this button is like plus six but if it's like counter hit you get uh plus eight so you can combo into level one which is pretty good and right now you can basically do level one randomly I believe it's very hard to punish it and uh yeah this button you can't kind of move back with this button like I said with the heavy Fireball so sometimes when when they're about to hit you you do this maybe you can avoid it and get a punish counter you can do this combo after which is pretty good so this is very common when you do this combo and get like a meter like almost you almost get level two right right there but yeah this combo is very good good at with punishing when it's very far but when it's close this is better so this this Crouch having kick is like almost no use so you can't use it randomly though but it's I don't use it too often and the most annoying button ever probably this one this is a Frank so it's actually a very easy to hit with this button and it's a knockdown after so yeah you can do a throw like that it's just it's pretty good you just press it randomly and your opponent get very annoyed and uh also this one really fast six frame and if they do like a wake up Drive revers let's say so this is minus 6 right then you can actually kind of combo with this so yeah pretty good because a lot of characters they cannot punish with the median uh normal so make sure to know that yeah you can just press a lot of Crouch medium punch you can actually confirm it into drive rush or whatever uh so you can do like this this is actually a good combo uh it's kind of weird how if you do this it's like not hurt as much but when you do a level one hurt more so it's only like uh a little few damage but yeah it doesn't really matter at all it's like 50 but yeah this is like a combo that few DJ players use so just remember that and the light kick is very good uh when you do like whff punish or whatever and when you do like like kick into Dy rush I think they cannot chall after that so it's pretty good but when you do this they I think they can challenge or they can DP but Li is like no so yeah if you want to maybe just when you have like six meter you can just do this throw him yeah and one of the most important thing is of course Drive rush just when you at a good r range you can do dry FR life punch which is like plus a lot I think you can always do a back heavy K combo yeah do this combo so the newest combo is like this I think this is like after the Patch but before you would do something like this but this is like kind of get nerfed and not that much damage just notice how much Drive gauge you have if you have like more than four bars you can do this because after spending four bars you can do another one right but if you have like three bars you can do the dry fres combo so it's kind of hard to decide though to be honest and uh you can actually do level two combos like uh this one I think this hurt a lot right is the max but yeah we also have another one that's like this oh wait wait wait and another option you have is this one this is also pretty good I don't know if this C Co this does but more meter just see if you need an actual 100 damage I guess and uh basically you just drive rush and throw Fireball and you can't even do this this is like kind of hard to block this is way too fast you see and when you get them into corner just throw Loop them throw Loop you can do median kick combo after that so and you can do like see me uh yeah when you want better range just don't uh Dash but if you want just want throw a loop you can Dash hey but you know when you do just walk you can actually shot me better right so it's all about mind Gams because when they're in the corner they will die instantly so make sure to keep that in mind oh and and lastly I forgot to talk about this B you know this is like kind of nerfed but it doesn't really matter if you're doing it at the correct range not like when I versus Phenom but well you know you can do this this is like really good because when they try to cheack it it will just give pun counter can do this into level three or something so yeah lot lot of possibilities you can cancel it into anything you know like whatever so just do whatever you want and with this character you know what's going to happen right and yeah I think that's everything about it so let me know if y'all want to see more of this uh or any other characters I actually play some other characters but probably not good enough to make a video about it but yeah I'll try to make more content and when bison drops I will make some new content I guess
