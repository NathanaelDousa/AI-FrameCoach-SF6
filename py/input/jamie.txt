can't wait for saon oh no way that's a setup L saon sounds nothing like anything to be suspicious of when is saon tell me more saon de nuts hey what's going on folks what's going on folks I'm automatic and you know people want the jam guy for the longest time but this character yeah he's very difficult to play if you're a new player it doesn't matter too much who you pick who you who you Plick who you pluck doesn't right doesn't matter too much what character you play but he's a very challenging character particularly when you start to get to the higher levels I'd say about 18 1900 Mr start to kick in like oh gosh this character has to work pretty hard huh so on top of managing the drinks managing the drive gauge the supers uh zero drink Jamie is easily the worst character in the game I think that's undebatable but the more drinks you get the more he starts to become pretty good and the other issue though is when you get to four drinks he's probably top tier but it takes a lot of work to get to that so for example if I'm playing against Ed I might whff punish him like like I might get a sharp whiff punish on him and then I get my first drink and then the classic you got to sacrifice drinks for Oki so rather than a lot of characters they just hit you and then they just throw you in the corner and you got a guess for your life Jamie has to play a little a little bit more neutral especially in the first round when you don't have any supers you know you don't ever start off with any drinks that's just how it goes but uh in this video I'm basically going to go over the tools like the basic tools that you have at Jamie to get those things going and as far as like very specific Okie scenarios I won't go too much on that I think once you have the tools to get to that position in the first place then it's pretty much easier to figure out so what are those things how do you play neutral and anti-airs pretty much which I do think that Jamie has one of the best anti in the game though it is very difficult to do and that is Tensai kicks but let me not get too ahead of myself first of all driver us jab how could one forget driver jab is incredibly important with Jamie uh Jamie is a character where people like to neutral jump a lot because of Drive Rush heavy punch because of light punch Palm heavy punch Palm whatever they're going to try to jump and hit heavy uh like a landing attack and it's going to punish your palms going to punish if you do d heavy punch but driver's jab is better because you can at least recover in time to up recover in time to uppercut them and you know when you're Drive rushing anyways and you see them in the air you can just switch your offense and that's a very important skill to have when you're playing against these uh creatures I've heard them referred to as these creatures in ranked so you need to have driver jab especially because it's fuel efficient and then if it hits them you you want to go into down medium punches as long as it's in range but sometimes you're not in range and down medium punch won't hit especially if it collides with one of their extended hurt boxes so you kind of sometimes got to settle for down medium kick if you get down heavy punch is cool but it's really you just want to get that first drink going uh yep so driver's jab incredibly important if you're only doing driver's jab it's not going to be that effective you have to play also with his other attacks such as palms palms are very necessary I hesitate to say good because the risk to reward ratio is just terrible if they whiff punish your palm if they jump over your palm you lose especially when you got zero drinks they put you in the corner you can't even dive kick got to uppercut with no drinks uppercut then drink and you're still in the corner it's really bad so you have to use these with Extreme Caution and a lot of observation to see what your opponent is really doing if they're looking for it but Palm can be a way that you can get those first drinks and they can be spaced so that you can be safe on block so when you do light punch Palm in a drink minus eight most characters can't punish that uh it's very difficult to do it as long as you don't put yourself in the corner with it like Cammy maybe her critical art can do it but for the most part Palm drink is one way to get it started in neutral and uh since we're on the subject of palm I also want to go over OD Palm you can hit confirm this in level two if you have a lot of Drive gauge this is very powerful this is very powerful this position right here is one of the best positions you can possibly be in as Jamie cuz uh whoops because you spent three bars to get there but you also regenerate Drive gauge when you have four drinks and you have them in the corner you're going to be able to drink and actually have Oki and that is one of the best place by the way to drink with Jamie generally I try to drink once or twice and then get my opponent to the corner to get more drinks but it it's it's not like a hard rule that I follow cuz uh you just got to play it as is most of the time oldie pal is really good oldie pal when it hits most of the time you can drink twice but there are quite a few ways to punish it most characters can punish it most people like they'll recover backwards and then they'll be too far away but if you recover in place after the oldie pal this is actually minus 25 so after you do a drive Rush you'll have 14 frames when you get up to still punish it a lot like if it's a Jamie mirror you can drive rushing then down heavy kick it'll punish him so that that's it oldie pal and you can definitely hit confirm this and on block if you activate level two this is kind of a I don't like doing it on block though I do it sometimes to force the offense but if if you can it's way better to do it on hit basically so you can guarantee the corner carry and have some damage out of it for heavy kick this is it's really hard to to use this move cuz it is pretty slow 16 frames is actually reactable it's very tough to do it to react to it with something like perfect Parry but the underlying issue is that it because it's so slow you might just run into you might run into some other pokes so if they're just even like they're not even paying attention for it they're just hitting down medium kick and buffering it's probably going to hit your Ford heavy kick and for heavy kick is cancelable into level two this is also something you can hit confirm and it's very good I didn't combo this is a buff he just got recently now these two combo into each other well the the target combo doesn't require counter hit anymore so this is actually really good you can confirm this and there's a lot of variations you can do for different kinds of pressure like here you can go into command grab but in general just the idea of being able to do this and not having to spend meter anymore it just take them to the corner and then you have a really strong position there's a little bit of pressure to make the level two work you know but at least it's not like it was before you just lose all your drinks that was silly the other thing important about Ford heavy kick is it's plus five on counter hit so most of the time you can get Target combo I still sometimes hit light kick just because like I'm not keeping up my maybe I'm not keeping up with how many drinks I have I know light Kick's going to work so sometimes I do that instead and that's pretty much it on punish counter you can get down medium punch if they're near the corner down medium punch goes into OD palm and you can get some good stuff there it's pretty much it for heavy kick the range is really good but it's just really slow you have to be careful with it and you can hit confirm into any super with this you just try it out random guard Pi confirm H confirm the block that's how it goes okay that's for heavy kick and now we got the coveted down medium kick everybody loves Sal of verity after down medium kick so first of all the way that you should use down medium kick Drive Rush on paper is with down light punch because this makes the it makes it so that there's no Gap in between this if you do down medium punch there's a two frame Gap you can see on the frame data line there'll be two frames that are empty well there's one box that is blank and then there's one more next to it right here so they can actually do uppercuts but some characters don't got them so they're going to have to perfect Parry or super but this is how you force the offense with Jamie the the recurring theme though is if you do get offense then you're going to have to drink so you got to slow down your offense unless you just go for Oki in instead of the drink but in the early parts of the round like if you end up with this a lot of other characters they'll throw you and then be able to do something else after that and Jamie can do that this throw is good especially in the corner this actually has good Advantage if they back recover you don't really get too much right here you can do Drive Rush heavy punch uh uh but it don't really do a whole lot so most of the time when you get that throw you're just going to drink so that maybe you can do something better later it's pretty much it though man you do down down jab off of that it's plus three and from there you can bait the throw and get a little bit more out of it it's really not it's really not that devastating but he does have down medium into dry Rush the good thing though is if this hits and they're near like maybe about about here midscreen you can't and hit confirm this into Tensai kicks instead and then do this this is very good this combo is unnecessarily hard but it does do great damage Corner carry drink oky that is really good so what I really suggest is putting the guard on random do down medium kick if it's a block you do down light punch if it's a hit you switch to Tensai kicks and then you drop that combo and then complain about Jamie just just like me he's just like me for real for real so it's still on random guard and when it hits them I switch to Tensai kicks and then I drop the combo see that's how it works perfect yep that's pretty much the best way to get started there's other things you can do like medium punch for other reasons and down medium punch this is still good it gives you throw uh throw position even though it doesn't jail them uh and heavy punch doesn't doesn't either you can do medium punch like if you have command grab drink three and then you can frame trap with command grab it's a you know it is what it is it's a command grab it's really hard to just like the problem is if you do all that you the next thing you do is going to be drink four and then if they're near the corner it's great but spending three bars of Drive gauge for opportunity feels terrible so I mean it's so conditional but if you have three drinks and you have critical art if you do something like this all right I can work with that and then this is going to do decent damage but that's so much meter for just you know to make this opportunity happen but enough about that that's it down medium kick Drive rush and stand heavy kick so this may be one of the most important attacks from Jamie it's also really slow but the distance is one of his longest range normals there's a lot you can do with this attack uh you can do heavy Rea and if you space that well it's hard for them to punish maybe not Ed though might have to do medium punch so Ed is really good at dealing with Jam's like that's still punished but this maybe I can space it so it doesn't punish and then you can do the poop headit thing it's a spacing trap bro whatever so here's medium Rea and then you can follow up with down medium kick heavy and that can you know know create this stupid mind game where they don't want to attack so you can press again so you can do like one of these and then maybe they don't attack and then you can do another one and eh but I actually highly suggest you find ways to gimmick your opponent with heavy kick like oh something like maybe medium punch and then I can fit that in there oh my God there we go like I I honestly I don't like it as a person but I recommend finding all the dumb and dirty ways that you can convince your opponent to get hit by heavy kick because the reward is just absurd you take away Drive gauge you get Corner carry you get good damage from it and you can even do like what I did before it's hard to do but you can still do this Ender here this is not the greatest example but the idea is still there like that is tremendous reward tremendous reward and if they block it it's doing good damage to their Drive gauge as well and also since there's more blocks St on the heavy kick you can use this to go into things like down medium punch medium punch and there's no Gap in between it so you can really attack their Drive gauge with heavy kick get drinks off of it it's just obviously slow easy to whiff punish it's hard to hard to use this did I demonstrate how Palms can be safe in neutral I don't know if I did there you go minus one don't get jumped on so yep stand heavy kick you can also do like Street Fighter 5 where if it punish counters you can change what you do so I'm going to do a reca so I'm doing heavy punch we'll just do medium punch Rea since that was working earlier it is medium punch Rea but it is punish counter so I can do Rea and then switch it to oldie pal because of the punish counter it changes the buffer window so then I can enhance my combo instead of just getting the kick Rea or just the punch Rea in the kicks so I can do Rea and then switch it over you can also do I think dry Rush is that right no yeah you can but you don't want to spend three bars for that it's not needed and then in the corner this is very good to do it costs no Drive gauge so if they're near the corner like right about here and you hit them with heavy kick this is too farbe a little bit closer like right here you can do that that's really good it's great better than bad it's good so Drive Rush heavy punch this is the thing everyone does it's hard to check it because it's five frames and the moving hurt box the moving hit box on it it's it can be really tough to challenge this with a fast attack because it might hit you while it's traveling so you try to check it you just end up getting hit counter hit so this is a pretty good move it is a tad bit overrated it's only plus one on block and outside of throw range so the threat is not that great it's good when it hits regular hit it's plus five so you can do at minimum light kick heavy kick uppercut rank that's pretty much it if you want Oki you can do Li kick DP Dash up twice plus four still good but the good thing is when it counter hits or punish counters you get a lot more out of it so this is plus seven on counter hit so you get down medium punch down medium punch is not that significant if they're not in the corner if they're near the corner it's pretty good cuz then you get old palm and you can pick them up with down light kick hold I missed but right about here there we go that's pretty good but as you can see it's going to dig into your Drive gauge quite a bit so one of the reasons why people see that like sometimes my gauge is kind of low as Jamie cuz like if I want to like drink and have offense I got to spend some stuff that's pretty much it cuz this is going to cost one bar that's going to cost almost two bars but we just got to have a lot of Drive gauge management with this character it's part of the difficulty of playing him so yep driver heavy punch and then if it punish counters you can get down heavy punch this is really good it's very high damage down heavy punch and then in the corner you can do all this you can cash out and even with zero drinks this does great damage yep zero drinks still good damage over 6K cool and if they're in the corner you can do some cool stuff like this this is a cash out combo uhhuh you can actually super here that does decent damage for level one but that's that's to kill them you want them to not survive that cuz you're going to be in Burnout it will put you in Burnout okay and one more thing for the neutral skip section is OD Rea so this is actually faster than heavy kick and I think it has slightly more range and they did buff this recently but not in the greatest way so let's see let's go a little bit further back there we go so from here heavy kick whs but Rea still has more range and it's faster and you can hit confirm the remaining parts of the Rea you know most of the time you're going to go into the kick Rea so you can get the drinks and yep and when you have three drinks this is actually real when you go into OD reca like this for heavy kick will actually frame trap without without the OD Rea this one is not actually real but I do it all the time there's a five frame Gap in between this so technically if they hit a jab it will beat it did I do that right let me try one more time yeah yeah I use it but it's not exactly real there's other things you can do though like maybe if they try to check you can do heavy punch and you'll hit them trying to check so there's stuff there but that third to Fourth drink knockdown is really important it's a really important idea with Jamie so you you can you can play to like when you're at three like sometimes I don't go for the four drink because I want the knockdown to happen at a different point so like for example when I do have these three drinks and I do kick Rea usually this is minus one but now it's plus 22 so there's some cool things you get off of that plus 22 means overhead is meaty don't really matter too much that is plus two yeah that's it you can also do Drive Impact this works way too often uh Drive Impact is okay there you can also do stand light punch command grab that's a frame kill and then off of there you get you know you get all kinds of cool stuff and you're always going to have command grab there at drink four Oda can also go into level two and four heavy kick combos off of that and we did that earlier so what are the honest LOL neutral buttons that Jamie has like what buttons do you when you're like being patient and you're being a boomer were waiting and with punishing what attacks do you use standing medium kick is probably the highest priority this is the first move that you think about because it does hi YouTube it does have a uh not really a low crushing property but it does deal with other low attacks very well because it doesn't have this lower hurt box on it so other like down medium kicks from Cammy Jamie Ken whatever this move is going to deal with it pretty well and it's hard to whiff punish it because of the amount of distance that it covers they have to be at a greater distance too so if you're using this right about here your opponent has to be really sharp to whiff punish it because they have to use something that's kind of slow so it's going to have to and and risky if they mess it up so they're going to have to do like their sweep maybe they're pre-buffering and poking smoo is kind of almost like in the skip neutral it's like anti- neutral this attack so you can buffer this into Rea you can buffer it into drive rush just like I showed before if it hits you go into that if they block it down medium punch is actually uh there's no Gap here so you can actually lead into throw with that Medium punch there will be a one frame Gap um but ideally I think counter poking is better with this so you can save meter you can combo into heavy Rea but I think medium punch is better most of the time just because if they block it you'll be at a better distance if you do it at the very tip like even Luke probably can't even punish this with down light kick yep and that's good so you can do one of those and then that's silly thing boom boom but that's too slow medium kick very good and also medium kick goes into Old Rea this can combo on hit very good so if they're near the corner you can go for the sweep and this is very fuel efficient uh if they're almost at the corner you can do Drive Rush stand light kick right about here and then heavy punch sweep very good and you get the plus frames off the sweep so you're plus four after you do sweeping a drink in the corner it's very good however you can't you can't walk backwards and avoid throws you can't actually shimmy with this unless you do like a goofy back heavy punch you got to walk back and do back heavy punch dive kick and that'll beat throws back dash it'll beat a lot of uppercuts but not all of them but yeah maybe we'll talk about Oki later I just want to get to the neutral and some of the anti-airs medium kick so that's it yeah so down medium punch and down medium kick and medium punch Rea these are really important you have to be able to whip punish without medium kick and get that first drink or whatever drink this is really important to be able to do so you want to space it in a way that it's hard to punish so yeah if you space it really well it's going to be okay but if you're too close you're going to eat it it's not good not good at all light punch is kind of nice too heavy punch that's pretty much all there is to it down medium punch you can also put this with Rea it's like it's almost like Luke's down medium punch it's hard to whiff punish this move but you still might get buffered on if they're just doing down medium kick Drive Rush and again the underlying issue is that your reward isn't really that great so if you get the oldie pal and they're near the corner that's pretty good but if you get like medium punch and then drink it's not that good but you you got to do it and uh heavy reca does work off of down medium punch so if you're if you're poking against something man Ed's not a good example but let's just say he's doing heavy punch maybe you can hit that with down medium punch and you don't really have to react either you can just be buffering it in neutral and if it happens to hit oh God oh God just Jamie problems my bad my bad OG now standing medium punch is really awkward to use in neutral because the distance is not that great and by the time you get to this range you're probably going to eat a down medium kick Drive rush and talk about how much you love the game but this move is good to use in neutral because you can attack their Drive gauge with it and this is plus two on block so when you're combining this with like down medium kick Oda is good for the safety on block if you have meter to spare it's not bad to do sometimes so this will be a five frame Gap most people aren't going to hit their light attacks from here and sometimes people just try to walk backwards so this is a pretty decent way to you know pressure your opponent a little bit if my opponent is blocking a lot you can do some sequence is like medium medium medium heavy medium Rea and then the the drive gauge exchange is heavily in your favor so this will force them to start moving if you do things like this like you see my meter is still half by doing that so then once I can condition them with something like that then I can walk up and throw them medium this and then hermit punch if they attack back there's a bunch of weird things you can do with this to make some plays happen but just in general medium punch is really good when you can find the gap to use it when it counter hits you can get down medium kick and that's a drink or it's Corner carry oh or you can go into this it costs a lot and sometimes it's better to not go for the the right combo just go for the sweep immediately just a a little bit on that combo it's really difficult to do obviously but if you mess up the heavy punch you miss out on so much like the purpose of doing that heavy punch is to get more Corner carry a little bit more damage more Super out of it but it's better to make sure you get the The Sweep in the drink that's the most important part like I've been doing that combo for months and I still drop it like 25% of the time the look of slight disappointment hey you know that's what you that's what you sign up for playing this guy this guy so yeah that's stand medium punch when stand medium punch punish counters you can also get sweep that's an easy drink and if you're close enough this is one of those those things with Jamie that you got to make this combo a little bit better this combo a little bit better you got to like add things just by doing a little bit more damage maybe you add like 20 more points of damage in one combo 50 to another and now you've done 70 more damage so like if the medium punch counter hits and you're close you want to do down medium punch instead of down medium kick because the down medium kick is going to add a lot more scaling so if you do down medium punch and you do something like this we got 2661 but if I do down medium kick 2571 so it does less damage not a whole lot but if you can if you can squeeze some damage in a different scenario it's just better and like for example if they're near the corner you can't do down medium kick into oldie Palm that doesn't work but if you do medium punch then you're in a much better spot because you can do pal off of that so like just having these slight improvements here and there is like critical to this character okay obviously sweeping is very important I don't recommend doing it randomly unless your opponent never Crouch blocks you can try at a distance sometimes but it's just the risk versus reward is just insanely bad if you do that but there are some things you can react to like Ed you can sweep some of his normals on reaction and uh do it three times so you can be as strong as he is this is very hard to do but it can be done there's down heavy punch this one's much easier and then what is it down medium kick you got to take everything you got just to get some get some drinks in a solid way with this character it's so hard to do it um and yeah you have to combine all of these together all these neutral tools that I've gone over so far you have to combine them cuz if you're only doing one and not the rest of them they're not they're not good enough on their own so you have to do Palms to make them look for the palms and when they're looking for the Palms you start doing dver Jab when they start when they start neutral jumping you got a uppercut so you have to make them move in a favorable way oh I haven't done um I didn't put overhead in this also I'm trying to use overhead a lot more so this is this is the overhead when you have no drinks it's not very good it it can go over lows I won't really go over that too much cuz it doesn't really matter it can go over lows but with zero drinks it's kind of whack when you have two drinks the the distance increases and and this is this is pretty good actually I'm trying to use it a lot more and then you can now it comes with a Target combo that now you can hit confirm they buffed this recently so let me see if I can do this a block oh I missed it block there we go hit confirm block I missed it it is possible to hit confirm this now it's very difficult but one thing that happens for me often is if I punish counter with it it's very easy to hit confirm it then if if that happens though then you want to just do the combo instead just uh plus five right plus five yeah so that's Target combo you can go into Bai or uppercut drink so you do light Bai for pressure plus four when you dash up or you do heavy kick uppercut if you want to drink but if they're near the corner do kick wre up but don't put yourself in the corner there a lot there's a lot of little little rules you got to follow just to make something decent medium punch Crouch heavy kick light punch Palm heavy punch Palm is safe now I actually like using heavy punch Palm when I'm close cuz uh you know it makes it safe if I do the Light Palm up close gets punished pretty easily so some people are expecting that so I do heavy punch palm and then maybe I'll do a dumb perfect Parry maybe a dumb maybe a dumb OD dive kick cuz they might try to throw me stupid yep so what else we got 6 HK we' pretty much went over that already with this the the neutral skippity skip 5hk punish counter Yep this is one of the most important things if you can get this to start hitting punish counter you're in business but as a poke it's you got to you got to use this move a lot it's very good and anything else 6 MK actually did write it down cool OD dive kick so you get dive kick at one drink and it's good because it unlocks the ability to get more drinks pretty much so let's say you do a string like so I lost my turn after I do that light punch so if I do like medium light it's their turn basically boom boom so I can just throw a dive kick in there and it's going to be safe on block that's pretty much how you want to use it you want to throw it in positions where you might be at a disadvantage but because you're in the air they don't actually hit you and then you're just safe you're safe on block which is not the best but when you do dive kicks that close it's always going to be safe now you can do dive kicks at a distance about after medium kick max range the dive kick will have plus frames it's not that good though cuz you're not in throw range but if they attack you can frame trap them yep that's pretty much it vaguely threatened go ex dive kick yeah you're not wrong pretty much all there is to it you can use it on wake up it's kind of tough to do it but you can use it on wake up to beat throws you can use it during their block strings when they have gaps and then it'll hit them now when it does hit most of the time you want to go into uppercut drink you can also do ah uppercut like likei uppercut I actually don't do this too often and then you have Oki when you're up close if they're in the corner this is really good go into drink I don't I don't want to go into it too much but there is some cool things you can do with this when they're in the corner there's also some bad things that can happen to but let's say they throw here and I O dive kick heavy light punch uppercut Dash up and that Dash you can do a lot of stuff with it basically so this situation happens quite often uh on a lot of the knockdowns and this doesn't work for every uppercut but it does work against EDS and you can punish some characters you can do big punishes on uh what is Ed I'm plus 14 so I'm just a little bit short so that's that's pretty much the idea though the dive kick will go over go over some of the reversals doesn't work against guile or DJ uh this a bunch of weird ones like manan's level two just hit you in the air but there's some cool things you can do with this that's pretty much it pretty much all there is to it without going finally into detail so that's dive kicks it is a good neutral tool yep and what is that level four heavy punch Rea what are you talking about oh oh when you have four drinks when you have four drinks with Jamie your Rea is now safe no matter what the distance is now minus three it also hits twice which gives you a lot of time to confirm what happened so especially if you have four uh if you have four drinks and critical art you can just hit confirm it and that's pretty cool pretty easy to do and when it punish counters you can combo off of it right they buff this a little bit this was always like this though you could always do this before they buffed so as a punish counter that's pretty good and the distance is really good too it rarely happens because Rea is so slow but it's pretty good because it it uh attacks her drive gauge as well so oh you know I didn't mention Ford heavy kick is good too now you used to have to do Ford heavy kick and then confirm if it's counter hit or punish counter but you don't have to do that anymore you can do forward heavy kick and then just hit confirm it which I didn't do oh I missed it there we go you can hit confirm the second hit now yep and from here you got command grab down medium punch lots of cool things and I think that's really it as far as skipping neutral and then the basic grounded tools to get you going with this character and I kind of want to leave it at that to be honest cuz there so like this is just the beginning like the optimization the things that you lead into after you actually hit them and once you get the drinks going that's really the the meat and potatoes this is just this is just like the pots and pans to to get to start cooking with them and that's already a lot that probably went on longer than I would have liked but that's a really good start I think I got everything somebody mentioned I can probably take questions in the chat too somebody mentioned back heavy punch earlier and back heavy punch isn't really a neutral tool you can kind of use it with drink three it stupid like you can walk into their ranges and then use back heavy punch cuz it has more of a back sway on it but then the issue with that is if you walk into that range your back heavy punch doesn't actually hit them so you want to do it closer at a range that's dangerous that ain't good either so it's just stupid there some ways you can set up might even work against some light attacks like this works okay but it feels like it's just doing too much and it's not NE it's not necessary especially for what you get off of it it's not that good like there's a lot of cool things you can do with back heavy punch first hit super cancelable you can space stuff like this do on a second you can space light kick and then back heavy punch it's just not that good just not it's not doing enough like Luke if you punish counter with Luke's back heavy punch which is better by the way like I think the ratio where he goes backwards I think he gets more he gets down heavy punch into charge flash knuckle you know what Jamie Gets plus five you level two and then it's pretty good but like it's so much work for not a whole lot of like too much effort for like the juice is it doesn't feel like it's worth the squeeze a lot but it's cool and it works that's certainly a cool thing that it's cool it's cool that it's cool looks is straight up special cancelable you can driers cancel off of it that's stupid yeah so yeah back heavy punch I wouldn't call it a neutral tool I don't know what I'd call it it's a funsies tool I guess one more thing that's worth going over is to be a dooky head and when you do things like heavy punch perfect Parry yep yep you do a dive kick perfect Parry I'm sorry I don't look I don't like doing it but if I don't just it's pretty much it so what happens so here's here's the thing that happens though when you start to perfect perrymore your opponent will start to throw when you do that and then when you got dive kick you can H I'm sorry but it it makes sense I don't like it but you can start to do that and then if if they're looking to see if you parry or not and then throw you you can steal your turn again you can do more stuff I don't like it but look you got to do what you got to do out here I lost 200 Mr last night I was I was almost Legend with Jamie got to do what you got to do man well I think that that about covers it for the skip neutral and grounded neutral I guess I can tag on the anti-air stuff it's pretty easy so you got down heavy punch this is the easy anti-air and uh yeah that's how that works light kick DP you can't actually drink after this I me you can do if you want to but if they don't rise a lot of characters going to actually punish it heavy kick is better because it makes them go further away but heavy kick is much slower so it's easier to miss and uh one problem with Jam's uppercuts is if they if they if they jump at like that range it's going to be hard to hit it and to deal with that you want to do jump back medium punch this is going to knock them down you can drink after that heavy kick also the same but it's slower and then if it's like an emergency and you saw it really late jump back light kick jump pack light punch they're about the same I think light Kick's better just for the hit box and that's pretty much it you can also jump forward with jump medium Punch If you see it really fast and then you can delay dive kick quite a bit that works pretty good now the best anti-air in the game in my opinion 10 side kicks this is a really good anti-air because it gives you so much right you can get Corner carry from this or you can drink and it's pretty decent for damage too only problem is it's not invincible and it's slow and the angles aren't always the best so here's what it looks like like if if you're trying to use T side kicks against Cammy it's a bad idea but against like Luke I think it's worth learning how to use use this so This attack is designed to be an anti-air and the reason why I say that is because this green part the HT box is below the hit box right here that tells me it's supposed to be an anti-air pretty much yep yep yep man I'm the worst with this pen now same with right here it's even better on the second active frame so it is designed to be an anti-air for three frames and it's also an anti-air that you can lead into a level three because you got the oldie dive kick uh what do I do yeah like that you can do cool stuff like that yep it's really good it's a really good anti-er a lot of characters can't combo off of their antire like that and have options so it's very strong if you have four drinks you get cornic carry but yeah it's good and if you think about how it kind of comp complements his command grab if people try to neutral jump I'll just show you it's hard to get an exact example like this because sometimes characters have some some characters have things like dive kick they jump and do a dive kick so if I set up command grab like this you know obviously they can punish but if I don't do anything or let's say I do a regular throw I try to walk up and throw them get anti-air and if that's too if that's too slow I can still do a regular uppercut that's pretty much it as far as neutral and anti-airs with Jamie if you want to see more if you want another video where I go into detail about his knockdowns and all the oky situations and character specific stuff just let me know like this video comment let me know if you got any questions appreciate y'all thanks for tuning in and that's the Jamie tutorial for that Ding I should have recorded use my archive again ew
