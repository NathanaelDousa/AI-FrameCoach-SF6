all right so let's say you want to learn Rasheed and Street Fighter 6 but you don't know where to start or maybe you have already started but you just want to make sure there's nothing that you're missing or you just want to see if there's any extra tips that you can learn with this character either way I got you today I'm going to be attempting to make the ultimate Rasheed guide for you guys playing Rasheed here in season 2 of Street Fighter 6 let's get started all right so to start us off Rasheed is a rush down mixup character he's incredibly strong in this current patch and a lot of people have even said he's possibly the best character in this game so he has basically an option for everything and I definitely recommend picking up this character if you enjoy Rush down gameplay and you enjoy insane Mix-Ups that are just really sick to do this is this character will be perfect for you but uh yeah let's get started with his normals all right so to start us off we actually have rasheed's standing light jab right here it's a four frame just like a jab should be it has a pretty decent hitbox I'm not going to lie and the fact that it can be pressed so fast like this it basically just ends up being a much better version or at least what Ed's jab should be uh but you know poor Ed uh this move is pretty good it can be canceled back into a light jab out of Drive rush and you can get a really good Ender out of this um which is really useful but yeah other than that pretty standard jab very strong overall though all right now we have his standing light kick standing light kick is very similar to his standing light jab you can put it out a lot maybe not as fast but it's also another 4frame move that comes out very fast decent range can be Drive rushed out out of uh but the main usage for this one that's different is that this one can be canceled into light Eagle Spike which is going to be very useful um other than that when it comes to loops and stuff like that you can do light or this so for the most part they're the same except for that then we have his crouching light punch uh this move is pretty decent overall uh it is a little bit slower than standing light punch at five frames but uh overall this move is still pretty useful it's not a low but it can be used to trick out certain opponents into thinking it is overall it's not too crazy or anything like that we can move on all right then we have Crouch light kick so Crouch light kick right here is also a five frame starter but this one is actually going to be a loow hitting move this move can't be canceled into anything but it can be used into other moves like this if you want to get like a low confirm or something like that so overall this move is pretty quick this move is pretty good at five frames uh can be Drive rush into I think this is the main usage I see for this move other than for mixups and stuff like that a lot of people drive rush like that into this move so it's pretty useful all right now we're going to move on to rashed's standing medium punch this move is incredibly useful uh it is also plus one on block which is going to be very useful for your frame traps and just to give Rasheed strong pressure that's very true uh very strong uh move right here honestly one of his best moves and it's pretty good range and it comes out at six frames so yeah that's that's privilege right there then we have his standing medium kick this move is at eight frames right here uh pretty good move to use for in the middle of combos but also it's a pretty good option to drive rush into it just has a really nice hitbox and I've seen a lot of people use this to beat out drive Rush as well uh one of the biggest uses of this move though that I forgot to mention at first is the fact that it is able to be canceled into medium on hit so you can go for his medium Target combo right here if you want to all right now we're going to move on to crouch medium punch uh similar to standing medium punch this move is also Plus on block by one uh very strong move right here I think the best usage for this move personally is to hit on mey so the moment that the opponent wakes up this is the best move you can use to counter out like a throw or something that they're going to wake up and do uh it has a really good hit box and it's just really strong for wakeups all right so now moving on we are getting on to one of his more important moves which is his low forward right here his Crouch medium kick at seven frames this move has a pretty decent poke range and can be cancelled into probably his most useful combo right here where he puts you across the screen with amazing Oki ends with eagle Spike uh yeah this this low forward is pretty good honestly I there is no complaints about this move I'm sure a lot of people probably know that maybe Rashid doesn't have the best pokes in the game but this move is very strong there's no reason to complain about this move uh so yeah this is going to be your main uh this is going to be your biggest move when it comes to to uh beating people out in low and punishing going in for a combo really good move really good move all right now let's move on to his heavy punch heavy punch right here at nine frames pretty quick I know the main usage I see of this move typically is like with WID punishes and stuff like that so um other than that it's just good for Combos and it's a similar like to a lot of other standing Heavies where it can be canel into like you know specials for more damage than like a medium hit or something like that all right now let's move on to his heavy kick heavy kick right here is going to be one of your best buttons for sure uh not only is this move safe on minus five on block that doesn't seem safe but the range that it would keep you at on block there's no there's no move for the most part that somebody can do at five frames to punish you at the range that you're going to be on top of that this move is just so good at keeping away the opponent and even whff punishing them for the most part this move has been used for so many different things uh it's just a move you're going to want to throw out a lot honestly all right so now we're moving on to crouch heavy punch this is another move I would recommend doing pretty often in normal neutral so you can see if you can try to grab the opponent it has pretty long range 12 frames isn't amazingly like fast or anything but the range this move has is pretty good and it is very good for Combos and stuff like that then for his Crouch heavy kick similar to a lot of other Crouch heavy kicks this move right here is just a sweep uh nothing amazingly special about this move I think it's pretty standard overall when it comes to being a sweep but that's what it is a sweep let's talk about a few of his jumping moves uh let's talk about jumping light punch jumping light punch is really not going to be used for the most part unless you're doing like a mix up say right here uh it is used a lot in this situation to mix up into low um but when it comes to just in the air there's better options for sure than doing jump light punch I'm not going to lie moving on to that we have his jumping medium kick this move right here is a really good crossup option and it can be canc into another medium kick uh which can then be comboed into the target combo into Eagle Spike so I like this move a lot I use it a lot seven frames decently fast I use this a decent amount to trade and just to get a little cross up combo sometimes when you need it then we have his jumping heavy punch right here jumping heavy punch is going to be a multi-hitting move right here uh this move isn't usually used on jumpins as much as jump heavy kick is but this one is mainly going to be used for like resets and stuff like this so you want to lock down the opponent in the corner uh because for the most part if you're just going for a jump in you're going to use our next move which is jumping heavy kick uh at 10 frames this move has incredible range this move might as well be like a freaking Smash Bros like neutral air this move is kind of insane like look look at where that hits the hitbox is not okay it it's honestly such a good move when you're jumping and this is most of the time the move that you're using it's pretty nuts I'm not going to lie and the last things for his jumping moves right here are if you press down heavy punch in the air you will actually launch on top of the opponent and do something like this you can do it into another heavy punch you can do it into another heavy kick or you can just use it for like mixups and stuff like that really strong move over here uh really strong move that I use pretty often but I wouldn't try to use this every single time cuz if you're in the air if they react they can like anti-air if they block it so just be aware of that all right now we're going to move on to rasheed's Unique moves we're going to start off with his forward medium punch this move right here at 8 frames is a pretty good move for with punishing just throwing out neutral stuff like that it has a lot of different uses and I personally think mixed in with a lot of these other options it can be used uh in a really strong way to throw the opponent off uh sometimes you can make them forget you have these options uh and also just a good move to like cover a lot of the screen you know like even if this move comes out at eight you might have faster moves but like look how much longer this move stays at you know like it's it's just a multi-hit pretty strong move overall and I recommend using this occasionally cuz off of punish counter or drive rush you can cancel into more Combos and stuff so pretty good move right here uh now we're finally getting to one of rasheed's most useful things and something that he does that nobody else does is his run uh he is the only character in this game where if you dash forward and you hold down he just straight up runs at the opponent he does not care about dashes he thinks that's stupid uh he wants to run so he's going to run full speed at you uh he does not care uh and this run can be canceled into two different things first one with a punch you will slide under the opponent uh this move is really good for going under Fireballs I have used this almost once per every match basically yeah if you're fighting someone using Fireballs you're going to use this move at least once or twice in a match at least in a round honestly cuz it's it's super useful uh you just got to be smart with the usage cuz it can get punished on block uh but a with a recent update this move has actually been made even better for some reason they made this move super cancell so you can do multiple supers out of this you can do level three for some reason you can throw a level two out right there or you could throw out level one so yeah options are endless here you can go off for some crazy stuff people have already found some insane like new setups and stuff just because of this uh so yeah I definitely recommend using this option a decent amount just be smart with your usage cuz it is uh able to be punished on block on top of that he does also have this move right here which can throw the opponent's off in certain situations I'm not going to lie most of the time that I end up using this move is most of the time when the opponent is getting hit uh in the air by one of these and I want to run over and smack them down for a little bit more damage but for the most part I don't see myself using this move too much it can be punished pretty easily and I think honestly the game intended him to use this move to throw off the opponent but it's a little iffy there are times to use this for sure but I would definitely not use this as much which is this run right here all right so now we have rasheed's overhead option his four heavy punch this move is incredibly strong and in my opinion one of the better overheads in this game it may not be like insanely fast or anything but it's not slow either and the fact that this gets such good damage off of like a drive Rush punish or something like that this move is pretty nuts I'm not going to lie boom look at that you can even go medium no you [Music] can't yeah really good move right here then we have his forward heavy kick uh this move does not hit overhead even though it looks pretty similar to his forward heavy punch the main usage of this move because it hits high is to go over like low hitting moves so let's say they're using like a quick little like you know loow hitting move or like a low forward you can use this to go over that move and get a punish on them so uh on top of that it's also used sometimes for like punish counter combos like stuff like that but you won't see it as much as some of these other moves all right now we have heavy kick this move right here I didn't even know existed until pretty recently honestly I spent so much time with this character and I forgot this move existed it has a pretty iffy hit box and that's part of the reason why you won't see it too much on top of that it also can only be used if you jump straight up so you can't jump forward and do it when I first saw this with the up AED like hit box I was thinking oh this is like a Smash Bros move you can jump forward and hit opponent up in the air that's not what this is for this is for crazy wacky combos that you can do uh stuff like this yeah some pretty crazy stuff you probably won't see that move too often unless you're going for some weird Combos and stuff like that but it is a pretty fun move to experiment with I won't lie all right then we got if you press uh two of his kicks together you got his side flip you press forward and two kicks boom side flip this move can also be pressed twice and depending on if you press forward or back he will go decently far or he will go very far so yeah this move is pretty strong I've seen it mainly used for like uh frame kills and stuff like that so you can use it in this situation for like a safe mey stuff like that uh overall you're going to probably be using this move a lot just wouldn't recommend randomly throwing it out because if a player is good enough they can probably anter it all right and on top of that Rasheed is one of the few blessed characters in this game to have an air throw and in my opinion it's pretty damn good if not like one of the best in the game this one puts you forward and slides a little bit forward as well compared to some of the other air throws in this game that kind of just either SPID swap you or they end up like just dropping you down the fact that he takes you a little bit forward as well I'd say that's pretty privileged I'm not going to lie so yeah just another thing that shows how dumb this character is all right so now we are finally moving on to rasheed's specials uh starting us off we have spinning mixer right here quarter Circle forward and any of your kick options will throw this tornado at the opponent uh this move can also be charg charged to various degrees you can charge it a little bit you can charge it a little bit more than that but the moment you see it turn white like that you have now powered up rine with this move your other moves get enhanced say that move boom all your special moves basically get enhanced it's pretty nuts I'm not going to lie this is this is at like the root of this character like what he is to be honest he can do so much with this uh the light version of this move goes at this Arc medium goes goes at this Arc and heavy goes at this Arc uh heavy is mainly going to be used to hit people out of the air who are trying to jump in on you who you are like prepared for that you can punish them light is the closest thing to a regular like Fireball that you're probably going to be throwing out at uh close to full screen range to kind of poke with a fireball this move is also really good at dealing with dlam in the air because look at that Arc it's kind of nuts as you can tell the further that it goes It goes up even higher uh personally I do think this is a really good thing about his fire balls and the fact that you can be charged you can wait for someone to jump even higher and then punish them and depending on which one of these little whirlwinds that you actually throw out of the opponent you can anti here somebody which uh makes them pretty strong I'm not going to lie uh let's say you know an opponent's like about to jump up you can hit him with one of these Boom Big combo and that can actually cancel into a level three so yeah God this character is so broken uh you can also do stuff like this yeah all right now moving on this is one is actually called spinning mix I think I accidentally called it wrong that one is Whirlwind shot now we're going to talk about spinning mixer spinning mixer right here is quarter Circle forward and any of your punches light is going to be a pretty decent uh move right here that hits a few different times and it stays on the ground medium is going to be a pretty decent anter option this move can be beaten out so I wouldn't use it as much as the next option uh but it's still pretty good at getting opponents who are like in the corner probably at like this range right here if you want to punish them uh and it's also mainly going to be used for situations to get like a mey setup and stuff like that and just for combos it's a pretty useful move uh but the next one we're going to be talking about is the heavy version which is his actual Main antiair in this game it goes straight up and with quarle forward heavy punch you get a really strong aner option uh if you get a little bit off of the range like right here it will miss which is kind of unfortunate but that's where the OD reversal comes in right here his OD spinning mixer it uses it moves at the Arc of the medium but it hits like the heavy it's pretty nuts I'm not going to lie and with the medium right here you can actually cancel into the OD version so it's a nice little thing to note all right so now we're going to talk about the fully powered up versions of this move uh when we're talking about the light version of this move it is actually going to make you plus on block and carry the opponent very far on the other side of the screen uh opponents can jump this so remember but if you time it out well this is going to be a really safe option right here to push the opponent further and to have some strong pressure on top of that the medium does what it already does but it takes them up even further but of course it's even more minus so be careful about using this one and the heavy up used up close is pretty decent for like Combos and stuff like that let's say that you get a full charge hit right here you can go into the heavy and pretty good Okie right here so yeah pretty strong move all right so now let's talk about Eagle Spike quarter cirle back and any of your kick buttons you have Eagle Spike uh light is going to look like this launches the opponent a little bit in front of you some pretty decent Oki right here um then you have your medium Eagle Spike which is going to launch you a lot faster and a lot further than the light you see the light will kind of slowly move towards the opponent and then on top of that we have the heavy which uh goes even further than both of these it goes full screen at pretty fast speed um it looks like it's about the speed as medium but it's just you know full screen so yeah and this this heavy one is going to basically do what medium does but it's going to launch them a lot further all right so the main usage of most of these is going to be for combos uh when it comes to light Eagle Spike it's going to be off of like mainly like light confirms and stuff like that Medium is going to be the main one you're going to end up using as this is the one that you do off of medium hits and it is also the one you do off of heavy hits uh heavy can not be done off of a heavy hit unless it is Drive rushed into or it is a punish counter on hit so for the most part you're probably going to be using the medium as you can get a lot more hits in beforehand which makes it easier to set up than getting a pure like Drive Rush hit and it's a little sketchy because if you pull this out and let's say they block that this move is incredibly minus the opponent can just run up and punish you if they block this they can drive Rush up and just get a punish counter so do not do this randomly uh then we have the OD Eagle Spike which is going to be uh similar to the heavy but it looks like I can't tell if it's even faster than that or not but the difference in this one is that it actually launches the opponent in the air which can then be used for a combo you can do another Eagle Spike after it you can do like a medium spinning mixer out of it you know it it really just depends on the situation but you have a lot of different options you can do out of this so pretty strong move right here again similar to the other ones don't just throw this one out randomly I would definitely recommend waiting for the right moment either in a combo or in a right like punish or something like that all right so now we're moving on to Arabian Cyclone cycle back any of your punches is going to give you this move right here which doesn't look amazing or anything at first honestly when I first saw this move I couldn't even tell what the hell it was supposed to do but this is going to be one of your best options as Rashi this option grants you multiple different options it's going to Grant you a little small little hit right here at the bottom it is going to Grant you an option to cancel into other buttons and honestly yeah it's just a really strong move for doing uh Loops which is really useful with this character uh stuff like this can be used with the cyclone and it can also be used to reset the opponent so you're going to be using Cyclone a lot maybe not throwing it out as much as some of the other options like your like Fireball and stuff like that but once you get on an opponent the way you get your frame traps and stuff like that is usually with a ran Cyclone like you know this FR traps right here you got this one uh light is going to be 15 frames right here mediums at 20 and heavy is at 27 best thing to note here is that if you hit Medium you're going to be plus one if you're able to press forward on this but how did I do that I pressed forward kick so yeah this move actually has uh two different buttons that you can press after it and it will do two different things if you press forward kick then your gu is going to roll forward and it's going to be used used for like we saw before plus frames and also it can also be used for like combos stuff like this and the other option is if you press back and kick you're going to fly forward in the air uh this option is going to be used a lot for mixups as you saw earlier this was the option that I did earlier with this little low mix right here uh you can also go heavy stuff like that and yeah you're going to experiment a lot with this move and find out when the best time is to use this cuz it is very good one thing you note is that I wouldn't recommend just throwing out randomly in neutral because a lot of people have gotten used to this move and will just light jab it cuz that will just beat it so make sure you wait for safe times to do it all right lastly with specials we got sky high jump in the air anytime you jump forward in the air with Rasheed if you do quarter Circle back kick you're going to get Skyhigh where he jumps off the air somehow and goes forward uh depending on which one you do and the direction you will fly decently far and this move can be used to trick out the opponent a little bit maybe sometimes if they're trying to anti a you you can get slightly out of their range um in my opinion the most useful version of this move is the OD as it flies down incredibly fast and is a really good option for getting a cross up uh you can even decide depending on which direction you go if it goes in front of them or if it's going to cross up the opponent so if you're pretty good at using this move if you find the right like time to use it basically uh you can really trick out the opponent and get some pretty good setups right here so yeah very strong move just don't ever use it too much all right now we are moving on to Rasheed supers so when we talk about Rasheed supers he's got three just like any other characters he's got his level one which is going to be double quarter Circle forward and then a kick this is going to give us super rashed kick boom uh this is a very strong super can be used on wake up to get out of certain situations this is the arc that it flies at so it can be used actually to hit people out of the air sometimes let's say you want it to just use it as an option hit somebody back in the corner or something like that or they're jumping in on you and you're nervous by anti earing yeah you can use this move I've done it before and it's honestly a pretty good option for stuff like this look at that sends them all the way over there all right then we're going to move on to his level three no we're not forgetting is level two there's just a lot to be talked about with that as some of you guys probably know so we're going to go back to that one level three double quarter CLE forward and then punch is going to give us his alter I think that's how you pronounce it uh this level three right here is going to be pretty strong overall does good damage it's a prettyy standard level three I'm not going to lie uh and now he has a new usage to this move out of his light Eagle Spike he can cancel into it uh this is not something he could do before and it's honestly amazing you're going to see a lot of people doing this now now that we've talked about his level three we have not mentioned a level two now we're going to talk about the move that people actually do for the most part when you're playing Rasheed you're watching rheed you're not going to see level three too much which is why I didn't really go too much into detail about it you might find uses for it but for the most part you were probably going to end up using double quarter cicle back kick the great Desert Storm This Tornado single-handedly puts Rasheed where he is all of his other options are amazing like let me be real this character has great options there's nothing he's doing that's like broken or anything but for the most part his options are just really good until you get to Great Desert Storm this level two right here single-handedly makes this character what he is depending on which button you press there's light medium and heavy you can get uh from what I can tell decent uh different speeds they look about the same but from what I can tell I think it's slightly different uh all of these are going to be rasheed's main option when it comes to insane pressure insane mixups insane like oky and like pushing the opponent to the other side of the screen the moment you throw this thing out it is now your turn to play there are certain characters there's a few characters in this game that have like certain options that beat this out but they usually have to spend meter or they have to spend their like Drive bar to get through it and even some of these people like Lily and characters like that they only get through it but that doesn't mean that it's their turn to attack yet it just means they get through it but the reason why that's not even that like crazy is because let's say they crossed up or something like that if they were on the other side of your tornado you know what you can do right you could just throw it out so yeah all right let's talk about what you can do with this tornado so once you throw out this tornado like I said before it's basically your turn you control the screen you're faster your jump is different you can jump straight up and it'll go forward so you can like cross up the opponent um on top of that eagle spike a move that was not safe before is now safe and takes you to the other side of the screen which is kind of nuts and then you just do it again um you can also decide to basically jump forward at a crazy Arc to fly across the screen basically all of your moves are enhanced uh the main usage for this move though that I see is to push an opponent down and try to get like a mixup basically um they will do that by either rushing them down with like shimmy options lows grabs and stuff like that or they will just do the old classic which is to just throw the tornado at the opponent this makes the opponent have to block either your little overhead right here it makes them have to block like a low and you can even throw this out and then walk and grab some people so like there's a lot of different uses with this I'll have a whole video talking about that specifically but for now all you need to know is that level two is insane and it practically makes Rasheed as good as he is to be honest all right so now we're going to talk about rasheed's game plan when you talk about rasheed's game plan you got to talk about the fact that this man has some crazy meaty options we mentioned them previously off of Eagle Spike you can do stuff like this he can also do stuff like this like the the options are endless for the most part that's what you're going to be relying on a lot that's what I see gachikun and a lot of the other Pros do uh they tend to play this game of pretty safe footsies for the most part relying on a lot of low forward pokes heavy kick and stuff like that occasionally throwing in forward medium waiting for antiair and anti aing they're not typically being like too insanely aggressive on the opponent uh until they have of course like gotten a hit or something like that because for the most part you do want to play this character like a lot of other characters you want to play Slow you want to kind of like wait until you get like whiff punishes and stuff like that but once you are in with this character then it is time to do his stuff that is when he has mix up options that is when you can throw out Arabian Cyclone that is when you can go for your mey setups and stuff like that that is when it is your turn to make this character as crazy as he is but I do recommend learning really strong footsies to carry this character to make him even better so then your media options you know your mixup options all that frame trap stuff it's amazing but it makes it an extra thing that you do that enhances your already very strong game plan so yeah I don't know if that helps as much but that's how I'd recommend playing this character all right so for the rest of this uh video I'm just going to be showing some combos that I recommend you learn with this character and yeah let's do it [Music] [Music] get [Music] [Music] spee spee [Music] fore the [Music] [Music] [Music] all right so yeah that's going to be the end for this rashed beginners guide I really hope that helped you guys out and if you guys have any further questions or any further critiques or anything like that feel free to ask me or let me know in the comments down below where I will happily respond to those I look forward to talking to you guys and yeah appreciate you guys for everything I'm going to be getting out of here so peace
