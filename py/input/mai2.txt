myi has just released for Street Fighter 6 and you want to get her a master rank but you'll only have one problem your my sucks don't worry I don't even blame you my is actually a fairly complex character I just recently got ma to high master and through my trials and tribulations I figured out a basic game plan and these tips and tricks that you can easily copy and paste Implement into your own gameplay and quickly level up and get to master rank please enjoy so for my's basic game plan we're going to think of a bit of a hybrid between Chun Lee and Aki kind of like a fireball dry Rush Plus+ sort of set play character um but one thing to keep in mind with Mai is that her basic Fireball game is not that strong while these are pretty solid pokes these fireballs and they come out rather fast um the start is pretty good these are not true projectiles meaning these are hit projectiles we can actually trade with them with buttons and then nullify them on the screen and on top of that they just lose outright to any um projectile in the game right so you actually get punish for throwing Fireballs you'll fall really far behind in the fireball battle Because unless you charge the fan it's not a true projectile now the problem with M charge projectiles is they take a bit of time but they're really strong once you do manage to get them on the screen but it could be hard to get ahead in the fireball battles but you do want to make an effort to be at mid-range and throw these charge Fireballs because on hit and block they cause this bounce so I categorize the Fireballs in kind of three different ways so the light Fireball is a lower bounce I like to use this Fireball to Simply cover Your Tracks as you get in so I think from like a bit of a distance it lets you set up a mix after with Drive rush so it's more to cover your approach I would say than to uh actually get any conversions from it directly you can sometimes do things like uh Drive rush into crunching light kick with it um but for the most part this one happens so fast it's more like to let you to approach since the next hit happens so quickly or to let you get a mix after both hits connect on the other hand the medium Fireball is much more useful for actually getting Hyo mix and then converting with the second hit of the projectile for example if I do something spaced out like this I can uh do the Medium charge Fireball Drive Rush low and then you see there that's actually plus 17 so that lets me go ahead and get a combo conversion that I wouldn't normally otherwise be able to get so the medium one definitely allows for a bit more like mix between the actual hits itself you know where you can go ahead and get a a low or a high same thing with the heavy projectile the heavy projectile actually has the most bounce this one sometimes has too much bounce or people are actually able to walk forward underneath it so I would say that this one is definitely good at a distance but I would also use this as sort of an approach tool um here and there so that way you can kind of cage them and see what they do and react to the situation so uh light and heavy I think is best for caging them and then reacting to what they do light can cover and let you get in heavy can um put the pressure on them to make a decision and then medium is best for the mix now other than that she is a bit of a zoning character so you're going to have to know how to anti-air I know these aren't really like sexy tips or anything we'll get into those very shortly but you can throw some projectiles mix in od to get the mix started and then get her uh antire game going her light DP is fairly strong it's five frames and has really good horizontal hits but she does suffer a little bit like Terry does where she has to mix between the medium and the heavy to get more horizontal range so for the most part for jumpins at sharp angles you'll be doing the light kick DP and this will be what you use for cross Cuts as well so there you can see I use the light DP as the Crosscut option so it it's actually a really strong anti-air but if they're at certain distances it can definitely be a problem there's a chance that your light one could whiff if they H jump at the exact right distance so things can go the wrong way for sure so you can see there heavy has way too much horizontal range sometimes so you have to be cognizant of which strength to use so it's something to keep in mind while you're playing so copy and paste tip number one for my to get you to master it's going to be this specific light string here so a big problem with lights in this game is that after a couple of Lights you know your pressure of ends and my here actually does kind of suffer from kind of poor light string Enders so it's hard to keep your turn and here you can see the dummy is actually walking away on block after pressing my lights which means if I go for like a tick throw here they're just going to walk right out of the range of my throw and escape the pressure but my does have a very specific string which is universal to some characters it's a common theme which is very powerful to implement it's this string right here crouching light punch crouching light kick to standing light punch this chain here you can see has the dumy tri to walk away after block in the first hit will pin them down and allow you to get combo conversion so of course the main combo Ender will be the quarter Circle forward kick the elbow Ender this one is really really strong does really good Corner carry good combo conversion from lights there's also other combo Enders you can go into the OD elbow for more damage and Corner carry or Corner carry is actually very good on a lot of these uh light confirms or if you're trying to go for a higher meterless damage you can end in DP but for the most part you're going to end in light kick elbow so this string just meeting with this string over and over will catch so many people trying to walk away from your pressure and it's really powerful to copy and paste so if you get like a random throw you just mix that in in the corner as well you can mix it in I mean some people just tend to never block and wake up so good way to rinse and repeat and get pressure over and over so the other reason why ending in this leg kick elbow is so powerful is because as you can see here you can actually Dash up and walk forward and get really strong pressure no matter which way they Tech so with this example the Luke is actually going to wake up with buttons after this knockdown and you can see here if we ended the elbow it's very easy to walk up and get pressure and you can even just Loop the sequence right so I would just practice doing this a little bit this is going to be really strong meterless oy and you can always convert it and like we showed before if they try to walk away from the potential throw you'll also end up getting um the low to combo anyways and if you finally condition people to to start blocking you can mix in the grab as well so this is going to be a huge core part of your game plan on the road to master is this light conversion to light elbow to midscreen Oki into strike or throw and using the jab crouching light extending light punch string to punish people from walking away from your pressure while this offensive sequence is really strong to keep your pressure going the problem with it is that you're doing very little damage so what if you wanted to get more bang for your buck out of the sequence that's where the next tip comes into play we're going to use the same knockdown here with the light kick uh elbow and then do Dash up back heavy kick so we already showed that you can actually walk up and get the light conversion but Dash up back heavy kick is an auto timed mey and you can see there if they wake up with the light punch which is what they're doing in this situation here um you can see the wake up light punch right there this will absolutely destroy them and you can potentially get a big combo cash out if you're able to convert from the counter hit as well but this is still really strong even if the opponent actually respects your offense and blocks because if you do this conversion and then go for that mey you're actually plus one on block you get to move first normally uh back heavy kick is actually negative one on block but this does hit mey so you get to continue your pressure after and uh do things such as this so you see here if you master this timing you can actually Loop this back heavy kick over and over on people and then convert with a jab after on counter hit to the same knockdown this was my basic offensive game plan without knowing really what else to do with my and that pretty much carried me to master so super powerful mey to smooth out your offense and keep the momentum going in a real match while M's elbow Oki in the back heavy kick mey after it is really powerful it requires you to be in range with your lights to get the party started what if you can't get into range to get into the elbow in the first place you're going to have to leverage some of M's other strong Tools in order to convert from these smaller openings and to get big damage this next tip will help you do just that so for my before she has her stocks from Landing here level one her main combo routes are related to getting into a situation where you can combo into the heavy Ren Buu which allows you to get jugle follow-ups right so if we get this we can go into something like light kick uh elbow right there for good Corner carry or if you just want a bit more damage you could instead instead end it with the heavy kick DP instead but there is an issue with this combo conversion you see this combo requires the opponent to be standing because heavy Rambo whiffs on crouchers which really limits your combo potential like you'd have to convert instead to like a heavy cartwheel or you'd have to spend meter to keep this going so your meterless combo options are really limited when the opponent is crouching but there is a way to solve this problem and with a string and a certain uh tool you can tie all these routes together and not have to worry as much about if the opponent is standing or crouching so another piece of this puzzle to remember is that Mai is actually a low forward drive Rush character so you know having a low forward to drive Rush is super powerful but once again if we try to do like a basic string like crouching um medium kick driers cancel to crashing medium punch to stand heavy which normally would be a decent route it just whiffs on them if they're crouching so instead of doing that into um this string we can instead use M's back heavy kick which forces stand and this kind of stabilizes all of your combo route conversions so you can do something like crashing Med cancel to back heavy kick which then will allow to link into crashing medium which combos into the Heavy reeno after forcing stand with the back heavy kick and it stabilizes your combo route so this is basically my go-to combo routing option with my helps really stabilize things so I don't have to think about it as much and uh still does pretty optimal damage so definitely a great way to force stand and get the party going another strong aspect of going to back heavy kick is that dry rush back heavy kick is plus three on block so in the corner for example if you go for this route and they happen to block it you immediately get a strike thr mix you can go straight into a tick throw so that's another really strong aspect of this it lets you set up a lot of throw situations or you know you can try to like keep the pressure going with some other uh offensive options instead um but it's really powerful to mix in that way it's important to remember though midscreen if they're holding back after blocking this they can actually walk out of range of the throw so something to keep in mind but um I do highly recommend using crashing medium kick the back heavy kick as a way to quickly stabilize a lot of your conversions using crouching medium kick into drive Rush cancel is key to get your wins to get into master rank but it doesn't leverage any of my's unique character specific strengths these next tips will get into that and figure out how to use her specific Tools in order to get your W's okay now with tip four we get into some of the fun stuff using M's unique tools and this is the best way to easily get the party started it's using OD Fireball with my this gives you an instant actual full projectile without needing to charge even without flame stocks and it gives you the mix as well so a great way to get this started is to use things like St medium punch buffered into it or stand heavy punch so you can do like a spaced out stand heavy Punch or spaced out stand medium punch and then cancel straight into OD Fireball and this puts you into a very advantageous situation so here I'm going to demonstrate one example that you can use to mix your opponent so I do immediate Drive rush to crashing Li kick after they block that and you can see there it's plus 14 so actually if they don't block the high low mix here correctly I can go immediately into heavy punch into heavy renoo and get my combo conversion that way now on the the other side what if I want to go for an overhead instead so in the same situation if I go for overhead you see there that it actually covers me with the second projectile until the overhead actually lands so here I would get my uh my normal combo conversion from the overhead and keep the party going that way and so to prove that this is really a dangerous position for the opponent I'm going to have them delay jab after blocking this to try to interrupt my pressure and you can see here that even if they they manage to like check me remember these projectiles do not go away after my gets hit so even if they check you on the way in you can still get in there and uh do things and get real combo conversions right so it's not guaranteed that they they can actually escape this it's a very dangerous situation for them regardless so you actually get to really apply the pressure there another option you can choose to do is to simply just hold up forward it definitely covers you on the way in so if they block all here if they don't uh block High you get a free jump in so lets you immediately apply pressure there but if instead they want to only do stand block it sets up an empty jump as well cuz you can see here if you empty jump from this you're actually plus one in that situation so you're able to get in and actually Force mix so it's super powerful and you can even more frame Advantage like if it hits further out like a spaced one like that see I'm up to plus six so you definitely get a real empty jump low pressure situation or maybe even like an empty jump into grab it just lets you immediately get in now you might be saying that's well and good but what if they just hold Parry to nullify the mix well in that case just drive rush into immediate grab right like this is like such a auto time thing just drive Rush grab if they're holding Parry now if you're further out and they don't Parry for example there's a chance you can whiff your GR grab you might have to delay the throw slightly but you definitely have time to get in there and throw them before the fan actually hits so they're forced to take a guess they can't just Parry out of it they're going to get mixed high low or throw and if they try to check you it can be very difficult for them to get out of there now some characters can do an invincible reversal to escape the situation entirely yes but it's really a great tool to just get the party started if you're out here and even from a distance you can use it as well to do things like Dash up or walk up into delay dry rush and then get a Hyo mix going so uh definitely use this tool if you're stuck and you don't know what to do OD Fireball might be your answer to get the party started my's OD Fireball is really good to get the party started and get your offensive pressure and mix going but what if you already got the hit converted and put the opponent in the corner what do you do there well the next sips will get into some nasty set play to mix up the opponents and get big damage so if you end a basic combo conversion with m in the corner you're going to find that after like a heavy Rand into heavy DP you're going to be plus 30 if you can see there in the frame meter and the teal on the upper bar you're plus 30 frames of Advantage there even if you end in the elbow instead the leg kick elbow to get Corner carry you're also plus 30 this is a pretty good number for my because it lets you set up mey charge projectiles if you're actually plus 32 you can actually get like plus frames from it but let me demonstrate exactly what I mean here so in this situation I throw the projectile and you can see it's actually hitting really meaty now I'm going to go ahead and turn on wake up reversal just to demonstrate this for you they're going to try to wake up with crashing light punch here and that's going to punish them now I can't even actually get a combo here from the the light one um it doesn't allow you to have enough frame advantage on hit even when you counter hit to get a combo but if you throw the light one you immediately get mix up here right so you can immediately go for a high low or go for a grab if they're waking up with buttons right there so it keeps the pressure going now if you do instead of something like a medium it becomes even more apparent what kind of mix you can get so if we were to do the medium here and they actually block low you see there it actually lets me get a combo from the overhead meterless right ends up being plus four so I can get a combo into jab right there if I were to throw the heavy even more frame Advantage plus 16 so you get a lot more options instead from that and if they don't Mash buttons and wake up if they instead block and then try to challenge after with a light punch well we can also see of course that doesn't end very well for them at all so throwing the light one there puts up a really nasty trap so even though normally you are negative on block if they block this if I try to jab here they're going to beat me to the punch if they do anything besides an invincible reversal they're going to get counter hit right after right so you get the counter hit right there and you're actually plus 19 and and I think using the heavy kick Target combo is really good here the back heavy kick three kick Target combo one of your best meterless options so you can do something like that and then end in the light kick DP or and instead of the light kick DP you can end in the level one which allows it meterless way to get into level one and get your flame socks going as well now of course we can use the other projectiles as well for different types of mix so you can do something like with medium projectile which you defend and then go for a high low mix and just keep the pressure going this is really strong because if you know about how projectiles work in Street Fighter 6 you know what utility a mey projectile has so there you have it if they try to wake up with a super it just stops that free and you're plus 32 look at the frame advantage on that that's crazy so one example of a combo there might not be the most optimal but you see the vision using mey projectiles is really strong always because it beats level one supers and in M's case it actually really puts a lot of pressure on the opponent because they don't know if you're going to go high low or throw in the situation while the set play is very fun and really nasty to pull off on a real opponent remember this is Street Fighter 6 you got to keep things basic sometimes and get some throws going but is there anything you can do to really optimize your throw pressure of course tip number six and the final tip here is the most abusable part of this whole video you can definitely copy paste this and start uh stealing a bunch of wins right away and that's the tech with M throw Loop now at first I discounted my throw loop I didn't realize how powerful it really was because it looks a lot like Terry's throw Loop um where if you dash up your plus three and you can get another throw so in this situation if the opponent to wake up with a crushing light punch you can Dash up and throw them and you beat their button which is very strong um but if they were to instead wake up with a back dash from this situation you can see that you're actually ne4 which means they can punish you with a jab if they read your throw Dash throw they'll definitely punish you with a full combo and you can't really make this safer because if you do a throw and try to walk up throw there's no way for you to walk in range and throw think of like a Chun Le in this situation right so you have to dash to get the next throw but my differs from Terry in a very distinct and important way you see after landing her throw you can Dash in and walk back to bait out the throw whiff this means you have a dash and throw loop with a really nasty built-in shimmy possibility which means big punishes so that combo right there is a basic example for not going into any supers after the shimmy you're able to take a step back and then see that the throw whift and then do charged OD Fireball which sets up this nasty extension then you use the Tor heavy punch extension to get the bounce and then with this combo you do immediate light ramboo slightly delayed light ramboo and then heavy DP to get that basic conversion now if you want to go into level ones you have other options for that as well starting from the same pattern get the shimmy charge OD Fireball medium reeno light kick elbow into level one get your flame stocks going and get a lot of damage now if you want to go into level three similar route medium reano medium elbow level three so really high damaging shimmy situation and remember this is all combo conversions without any flame stalks involved and you get really big damage if you set this up so abuse the throw Dash throw Loop in the corner and then finally cash out with the shimy and kill them if they whiff the throw with a big damaging combo and those in my opinion are the easiest tips to copy and paste into your own gamepl to quickly level up and start getting wins and rank up and master rank remember you have to have the fundamentals down in order to proceed if you can't anti-air you're not going to be able to play a solid game plan people will just jump at you all day and exploit that weakness now you might have noticed in this video I didn't go into her flam stck Shenanigans at all and that's on purpose I feel like M level one is actually a little awkward to combo into either you get a light confirm and immediately cancel into level one or a lot lot of her routes are gatee kept by spending OD meter to get a Juggle midscreen to get into her level one and even then utilizing her flam stocks effectively without just wasting them really quick is kind of complex as well so to be quite honest I didn't use her flame stocks at all to progress with her through master rank now I do think it's required to optimize that at a higher level it makes my a really complex character so if you want to learn more about those flame socks uh let me know in the comments below I will be learning to optimize them as well myself but I do not think it's required to get to master I think with these tips and some basic fundamentals you can go very far thanks for watching peace
