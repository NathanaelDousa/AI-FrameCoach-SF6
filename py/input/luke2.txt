wrap this up too slow [Music] Luke is an excellent well-rounded character that can do a little bit of everything and have a tool for every situation his sand blaster is a pretty good zoning tool that is true to annoys opponent because of its fast travel time and when they happen to jump he got the anti-airs with his crouching heavy punch and his uppercuts who will cover most angles his grounded normals are also excellent most of Luke's normals will move him forward and this allows him to have easier times and most characters to wave punish when someone happens to extend and when he happened to lands a hit his combo damage is really high and Corner carry is very good as well his combo conversions even from lights are extremely good because his crouching light Bunch can be Drive Rush canceled and you get big damage out of that it also can be canceled into ex flash knuckle for good combo juggle is standing light kick into drive Rush is one of the strongest tools in the game at checking opponent and converting from that into Combos and Corner carry and once you happen to get them in the corner he got a real slow Loop that you can harass the opponent with and also he got the ability to go into ELO or overhand Mix-Ups out of his Drive rush in knockdowns Luke also happens to have probably the best level 1 super in the game the startup on it is very short it's fully invincible so this will allow you to manage a ton of things and it's very easy to combo into seriously his level 1 super is good enough to make an argument for modern look being very viable Luke also doesn't really have any shortcomings or any flaws in his character design the only time you may face some issues is against heavy projectile zoning once opponents have a better Fireball than you like say guile but it's not that big of a deal because a jumping will be very rewarding for him and in general you can just outplay your opponent Into The Ground Luke is just amazing in all aspects of Street Fighter 6. foreign okay so as we always do we're gonna start first talking about a character's light moves and I'm gonna start first with his crouching light punch because this could be one of his best normals in all honesty it's four frames so it's the fastest e move can be in Street Fighter 6 and I got really good range right uh for a full frame the range here is fantastic it's really really good now because this is your fastest move if your opponent is approaching you this is what you want to use defensively right let's say also if Ken is doing like a block strings something like this and you know there is a gap there and you wanna challenge uh this is your best bet now what makes this move so special is what you get out of it right you can combat into itself three times and still get a light flash knuckle this will knock down and you can also combo it into an ex flash knocker right and this opens up a lot of possibility I just said that it is a move that you would want to use if the opponent is approaching right so now you can do stuff like that combo into 71 Super and now you have gotten yourself a lot of space to work with and got away from the corner situation right for defensive usage this is great but this move is also excellent if you want to spin meter on Drive Rush right because you can cancel it into a drive rush and then combo it into itself and notice here look who's plus eight so a drive Rush canceled or a drive Rush a crushing heavy light punch will combo into crouching heavy what I'm trying to say is like if you interrupt an opponent who's trying to approach you like that like candy is right you can get a situation like that get a driver's combo now I have bullshed him almost all the way into the other side and I'm pressing him defensively you can't ask for more than that this is pretty much Perfection now it's also amazing offensively because I said it comes into itself three times but also you can do you can go crouching light Bunch light kick into another light punch right what makes this so good is that obviously like if he's blocking I can throw him after that or I can go for the low check to catch him walking back this makes it particularly powerful and even in the corner situation like that you want to shake them getting up right uh like you can't easily harass him with it so it's great combo tool it's great defensively it's great as an offensive uh Rush down frame trap tool one of the best moves in the game and the range on it is fantastic for you for free awesome move you're going to be using a ton of it uh next up is his standing light punch and his standing light bunch is pretty unique it's seven frames which is really slow for a light uh I don't I think it's probably the slowest light in the game it's either H or zenge if light kick I think they're both seven frames but it moves him forward a lot and obviously got a Target combo attached to it light medium heavy on hit you can either go into whatever you want right but I like to go into heavy flash knuckle because it gives you like a decent knockdown but if you want to go for a corner carry stuff I'll go for the ex knuckle this will pop them up as you saw and then like get the heavy knuckle and this will give you better okay but obviously you're spending more and it's it's it's scaled a lot so I don't know it's like I don't love it particularly but it's good for carrying them to the corner now this move is pretty ridiculous on block notice here it's -3 which typically means that you don't get much right when it becomes really annoying is when you get the opponent into burnouts right because once here Kane is in Burnout this becomes plus one on block so with this range of gods it means infinite it becomes a very annoying tool right and because it can be a plus like that uh it's also very good out for Drive rush because it moves him forward so even from like a full screen distance like that uh notice how much I moved forward so it's a pretty good Shake tool it's gonna be part of your neutral typically his standing medium punch is better and the startup difference between seven and nine isn't that dramatic but still pretty good especially like I said in Burnout right and the target combo um you can do this unblock if you want to make yourself safe like you just cancel into the ax Fireball I know some people like to do it and then like go for it charge it heavy knuckle but this is gimmicky can be countered the safest option it's just the ex uh Fireball this is how you make yourself safe right and obviously you can even like cancel it into dry brush to continue your pressure next up is his crouching light kick and this by itself is pretty good and it's good in conjunction with a crushing light punch like I just said it's a low as that you can combo it into crouching light punch and then flash knuckle but it's also pretty good as a move to use from Drive Rush right because it will just automatically always chain into a scratching light Bunch like that right so if you want to surprise the opponent with a low from long distance and get some follow-ups out of it it is good in that regard and like I said just with shaking with this sequence right that's really really good now let's talk about his standing light kick because this again is also one of his best normals this is a great buffer doing standing light Kick let me turn on my inputs so you can see what I'm doing um where is it all right so you want to do a light kick and then do Dash right and if the opponent happened to run into it right you can always get a driver rush into crouching light bunch and like I said previously because this will let you combo into crouching heavy you can get a lot of conversions out of that a lot of looks moves uh or a lot of strategies could be revolved around setting up spacing traps like let's say you did stuff something like this like a crouching medium punch into crouching light punch now the opponent may try to take back their turn but then you surprise them with a standing light kick and cancel it into the forward drive rush or just even catching forward movement like that is a very viable strategy with him so let's now move over to Luke's medium attacks I'm going to start first with his standing medium kick this is the most straightforward poke you want to ask for in this game it's seven frames and it got a lot of range obviously with Luke's walk speed that makes it really good and it's great against crouching medium kick time moves if the opponent is checking you a lot with lows this is great against that right now on with it's 29 total frames uh so you are kinda susceptible to drive impact but it can be a lot worse for other characters so this is as good as it's gonna get really for that right you want to control the space with it with the medium and the light uh sand blasters and obviously his forward heavy Bunch it's one of your main tools to control this Dash distance right now next up is his standing medium punch and this one is really big forces character it moves him forward a lot right just like his lights and light punch media much heavy Bunch all of them move for him forward a lot notice how far he goes with this one and it is nine frame startup that is really really fast right obviously got a Target combo attached to it which is for mediums and it is pretty good to use as like a with punish tool notice can wave the scratchy medium kit so you get the width punish and you can super cancel up to the second hit right so if I'm doing the second hit I can just go into any of the supers level one two or three all of them will combo but what makes this move really stand out to me is how it works with Drive Rush right because obviously Drive Rush kind of boosts the forward momentum and it already moves look forward he moves forward so much so quickly with Drive Rush when you just drive rush into standing medium much notice that's kind of crazy right so this is what I like to use it for and even obviously on block typically it's gonna be like -3 what was Drive Rush is gonna be plus one so you can always like can't adjust yellow Drive rush in standing medium bunch and then let go for a grab or like frame trap with some with a crouching light punch that's all really good and like I said it's a pretty good with punish but the good thing about it is that when you're having to get the with punish uh it's gonna be plus six right and plus six means that you get to combo a crouching medium uh this one was like too far but here I got to combo crushing medium which obviously means that I can combo a lot out of that right so this is gonna be one of your main control tools it's an excellent with punish move for Luke now let's move over to his crouching moves starting first with the crouching media kick let's start with the medium heat first this is very standard uh crouching medium cake it started with eight frames uh the range on it is actually pretty average compared to the other characters and obviously you want to use what you do a lot with other characters in this game which is crouching medium kick and then like cancel that into drive rush and press the opponent after or if you happen to get the hit Drive rush into hits right now one thing that is really unique about this move is that it got a Target combo attached to it which is a down medium cake into down heavy bunch and you can coin the hit confirmness and when you happen to hit confirm it uh you will be at a plus one advantage so you can throw them afterwards right this is very unique in this game you're not getting a ton of damage out of it but it's putting you in a pretty good situation right if you have played Street Fighter 6 in any capacity you know how powerful crouching medium kick include Drive Rush is and obviously uh like all the good combos you can it out of that and even as your opponent happened to block you're still in a good situation and just doing something like Drive rush into it and then drive Rush canceling it is pretty good so it's a very standard crouching medium kick that you will want to be using a lot now the final medium he has that is not a command normal is his crouching medium bunch and this is probably the Cornerstone of Luke's pressure game because this is plus one on block so you can frame trap with it into his crouching light punch and the really good thing about this sequence is that it's a natural combo on the head as well right so if you happen to do that sequence and they got hit hey combo and then obviously you can get like a light knuckle or like an ex knuckle right the move will also combo into standing light kick so if you happen to get the hate from further distance this also works and then obviously light or ex knuckle or like Drive rush and get more and it's also very good to use out of a drive Rush uh because outfit Drive Rush crouching medium Bunch becomes plus nine which means that you get a crouching heavy as well right this is also really good the headbox on it is really good so it catches a lot of flows right it's one of the moves that you kind of want to use to buffer because it can lead to a lot right but mainly you will use this for pressure as probably zebraimir used for it and obviously useful in combos I will be leaving a combo section at the end now the final medium he got which is a command normal is his overheads right it's 21 frame startup it leaves you at a plus to Advantage which isn't that amazing but if you somehow happen to get like a regular count rate it would be plus four uh so you'll get like a jab jab outfit but what makes this really good is the fact that you can use it out of a drive brush to set up a low overhead gimmick right because like you can drive rush into crouching uh light kick and this is a low sequence or drive brush into the overhead this is gonna be plus six so you can go for like a medium let's let's do it one more time right here on plus six which means I can go for a medium and then bam right crushing medium crushing jab and then gives a follow-up all right so let's now talk about Luke's heavy Normans and I'm gonna start first with his heavy punch because just like his standing light and medium punches this one also moves him forward a lot right and look take a look at the distance like he moves away so far with this one what's really good about it is it's also special cancel look just checking ways is standing heavy into a heavy sandblaster this is pretty much like in the look Bible uh you're gonna be doing this all the time and this is even good versus an opponent who's trying to drive impact what you do after the heavy right right she's trying to drive here I get to drive in Max as well I'm Punisher so this is like a fantastic string right and obviously if you're not doing anything uh this he leaves you at like a zero advantage and then but you can try to shake their movement with a standing like or catch the start of a button now because it moves him forward a lot and the headbox is like really active as well it makes it really good move to use as a width vanish right and obviously like you can get it into the uh heavy knuckle and just doing something like this into heavy knuckle into level three this does a ton of damage on characters right and obviously if you want to use Drive Rush uh you can get more as well right obviously here I messed up the combo but you get the idea right this can lead to a lot of damage it's gonna be one of your main tools especially once you get the opponent to the corner uh fishing with it into just a heavy Fireball it's gonna be a very big part of your gameplay and obviously you can also like with punish wizard uh into the Run shoulder right this also leads to a great knock down if you want to go for something meterless it's it it's obviously one of his best with punish tool as well and the startup is 10 frames so it's not that bad but obviously got a lot of recovery on Wave so you don't want to be whiffing this one uh next up is his crouching heavy punch uh obviously this is an anti-air and it's actually surprisingly good as an anti-air it hits like directly above Luke's head right so if you if you can't or if you don't want to do like the DP this is an amazing anti-air move to use and this is a key move in your combo game right all of Luke's Drive Rush combo leads into you Landing the crouching heavy bunch foolish horse is a light nocule and obviously this is like the easiest route and then like go do whatever an overcut or like a medium knuckle I mean all of that is fine but you wanna get the juicy stuff with Z perfect and the medium knuckle as well because out of a crouching heavy Bunch like you can get the medium knuckle and this leads to a lot of damage if you follow up on the uh like Corner bounce combo so it's a key move in your combo game I will talk more about this in the special move since it have a lot to do with the knuckles and obviously combos as well you'll find the combo section at the end so it's an anti-air it's a very big board with his combo structure now next up let's talk about the forward heavy punch and this is good for Luke if you play Street Fighter 5 this is pretty much like a bison style psycho ax it's a move that you can throw it moves him forward a lot and obviously uh like if you're having to get the hit on this one uh like you can just do the second hit and just like a turbo combo and you can cancel this one right and if you have it to do it and it's on block guess what I mean that's still pretty safe right honestly you'll be safe um it's pretty good in that regard right as a Target combo you don't want to do it on block because the opponent may try to interrupt you and they will get the interruption so it's foreign move can lead to combos pretty good check in my opinion right now next up we're going to talk about his kicks I'm gonna start first with the back heavy kick this is a pretty good anti-air although you don't get much out of it like at best you're gonna get a situation like that you used to get a lot more in zabeta but now unfortunately he doesn't but what's really good about this move is its utility in combos right because typically it's leave you at a plus for Advantage so you can link a jet afterwards but obviously out of a dry brush you get a crouching heavy uh so right as you can see I know probably as you saw in the intro these two moves combined make up for the bulk of damage unlocks grounded Drive Rush uh combos right it's very very important in that regard right and otherwise there isn't that much that you can do with it like you can catch the opponent on a punish counter with it as well like let's say for example the opponent did something that is punishable and you got the punish counter this is a move you want to use for that reason uh because it puts him in his pen state like let's make Manisha with something right but let's say she with that I want to punish with that uh back heavy kick because you do get the juggle State here you can just drive Rush forward crouching medium punches will hit and then like you can get uh like a follow-up combo into crouching heavy punch and that is the party starter so it's a decent anti-air useful in combos it's gonna be your main punish counter moves now next up is his uh standing heavy kit and this stunning heavy kick is particularly interesting because it got a lot of active frames right as you can see it's got six Active frames and if it spaced well if like if you're spacing it as a maximum range something like here maybe uh you can be up to plus four and this means that you can get it to combo into his crouching light bunch right and get a follow-up out of that even on a counter hits I will be like plus six so you get a medium it's pretty good especially in the corner uh because like you can set it up after this roll right and we at the plus four advantage so you get to press them afterwards even on block if you happen to get like the good spacing right that just wasn't speed that will as you can see like you can get I believe you can get it to like zero I believe you can space it up to be like neutral on block but maybe it's like negative one is the best you can get right but it's pretty good move to throw out it's really active and if you're having to space it well you are safe right uh it can be used in combos also it's kind of finicky right it does this like a little pop-up which is uh pretty funny uh obviously I can get like a Juggle uppercut here but that isn't like the optimal damage and if you happen to get it as a punish counter it locked launches him in the air and then like you get to follow up combo which does good damage but again it's not really what you want to do you want to use the back heavy kick for that aspect right and finally we got his sweep and this is just a typical sweep that you can use it for with punishing or you don't really want to combo it into it that much it's just a regular sweep the final move that Luke got is his back heavy Bunch this is his suppressor V scale 2 from Street Fighter 5. it's very good in this game because you can use it in the neutral notice looks kind of moves backwards is this way movement here and this little step back makes it really good in the neutral to bait and punish moves but here Marissa is gonna move forward and then crouching medium punch as a little back movement can force her emotion to lift and then I get mine to hit right this is one of the main uses for it you can use it in the neutral and as you saw it's cancelable here and you get ton of damage outfit but what's really good about it as well is its utility against rows especially impression right obviously the move by itself is -3 so it is safe and you can special cancel it to make it like even safer but if you happen to land it as opponent say go to wake up with a grab here you will be plus seven uh you can immediately like cancel it itself into like some Knuckles and get combos or even just uh go for a crouching heavy Bunch afterwards right this should be like a two hitting combo and that could lead to a ton of damage uh if you Blade Street Fighter 5 in any capacity this is kinda similar to a guy upside down kick in terms of futility look can get thrown out of it it's not like so Invincible right so there's a little bit of timings that you have to be aware of and it's more of a spacing thing like yeah you need to take like a step backwards and kind of time it uh like when you protect the opponent will try to throw correctly so it's not like a brain dead throw bait but if you have two legs ahead hmm it can lead to a lot of damage it can lead to a lot of damage but if you happen to but if you happen to land the hate it can lead to a lot of damage all right so let's now talk about Luke's notable air normals and air removes in general I'm gonna start first with his jumping medium kick because this is your cross Hub and this is good enough because yeah you can easily combo a crouching heavy afterwards and get like a pretty good damaging glue combo with his flash Knuckles and now let's stop DJ from doing that right uh his zombie like it can also cross up but you're only getting Jabs out of that one and the range on it and when it might cross up or not it's a little bit tricky right a jumping heavy bunch is actually pretty great the angle on it is very downwards uh so if you like if you're jumping from close distance like that it looks like you're gonna cross up with like a medium kick but then a jumping heavy black will hit from the front just because of how much like downwards the hitbox goes right obviously if you're doing that early you're typically like not getting that much but you'll get like a crouching medium punch afterwards so you don't get Z Max now damage for like maximum damage you want to land it a little bit deeper but if you want to get an attack that is easier to get Max damage out of while not as great uh you will want to use his jumping heavy kick now this one is also more uh horizontal as well but obviously like you get an easy combo into crouching heavier so that is the target I'm gonna let the jumping into crouching heavy punch uh his jumping jab is um pretty noticeable as well it's pretty good to use as like a like his opponent jumping at you uh or like zombie at you because it's quick and the headbox on it is pretty good for air-to-airs but what you really want to use in this situation is his jumping medium punch I'd even say if the opponent is like trying to go for a cross-up on you uh jump back medium bunch is the way to go this sets up a Juggle State now obviously there is like the air knuckle and you can get this to come out of his jumping media Bunch right and this leads to some pretty decent damage overall right so for air-to-airs jumping medium jumping light for jumpings medium kick like other cross-ups jumping heavy punches kind of tricky jumping heavy kick is pretty much more standard all right so let's now talk about Luke's special moves I'm gonna start first with his Fireballs as they are pretty unique Fireballs in Street Fighter are because of the travel speed of the Fireballs obviously got different versions as the light moves the shortest distance so it's it's about like a book you want to think of the light sandblaster as a book you want to use it from this range it's 14 frame startup disjointed headbox it's really fast so the opponent may just walk into it and that makes it good but obviously 47 total frames so you are susceptible to jumps Drive impacts all of that right you don't want to spam this one because the jump will cost you a lot right now move to this distance maybe and the light sandblaster with and you will have to use the medium sand blaster 17 frame startup they are less likely to walk into this one also obviously it is possible so it is a little bit more suitable to be used in the mid-range but still carries the risks of getting jumped in all right [Music] obviously move back a little bit more and it whiffs so you want to use the heavy sand blaster this is 20 frame startup it doesn't go full screen like his opponent is full full screen it doesn't reach that far but it reached about like 80 percent of the screen so if I'm from this range maybe it will reach so not quite full screen but almost right and this is important because there are characters like Ryu for example who may just want to sit full screen and charge dungeon so if you can't really like Shake him from this distance you're letting him getting away for free this is important to know right at 20 frame sort of this one is reactable it's very unlikely that the opponent will actually just run into this one it doesn't really happen but what makes a heavy Fireball particularly Goods is the fact that it's really good on block right heavy Bunch into the heavy Fireball sandblaster this is really really good and uh because obviously like in the neutral likes that you would be plus one so you get to act first maybe poke them or try to do like a medium or whatever but what makes this British bit is actually burned out because if you got the opponent in Brunner the heavy Fireball here will become lost like regardless of the range something like this becomes plus five and uh it has heavy Bunch into the heavy uh sandblaster right plus five so you get to harass the opponent here right becomes pretty ridiculous okay you see like you get to do a ton with this one so it's pretty stupid and burned out uh finally obviously we got the ex Fireball very very fast goes full screen this is the one that will go full screen right so you you want to keep that in mind so it's the opponent like to just run full screen and set up this is how you stop them and obviously it is very good in Fireball Wars uh simply because of the travel speeds right it's very easy to punish other Fireball users with this one and obviously got the second board that you might want to use if you want to attack in a little bit more damage now one thing I want to quickly mention is a situation where you will land the target combo right like this one on block a lot of look players will try to move like a heavy Fireball but then get Drive impacted or like go for a heavy knuckle and then get Drive impacted if you want to be safe just cancel this one into the x-fire move right notice here I was able to block which means that I'm able to drive impact as well so if you happen to commit to this target combo and you want to make yourself safe ex Fireball is the way to go right in a lot of situations this is the best way to make yourself safe it is safe regardless of the distance and it's very hard to punish from an opponent right now next up uh let's make a new Jump because we're gonna talk about his uppercut right pretty standard show you can style move light medium heavy they vary in speed uh light one is five frames heavy medium is six and heavy is nine so the heavy one is the slowest and that doesn't make it a good one to use as a last second until you're going for the last moment anti-air deep overcut use a light because it comes out the fastest but uh like the heavy one as you'll see you might actually get hit I don't recommend going for the nine frame DP as a deep uppercut right now one thing you will notice is that they all move look forward right and this is tricky when the opponent is jumping at you because let's say here Rio is going for cross up this is very possible this might happen to you uh because of the way the move goes Luke might just walk under them or like move forward under them and this gets you punished so if someone is jumping very close to you I will recommend going for the crouching heavy punch attire right um for the most part this is consistent obviously like you can go for like cross Cuts but I don't really recommend them again in this game because because of his forward movement John barks a general movement they are prone to whiffing what I like to do is just walk back and crouching heavy punch this is easy consistent and it works right it's crouching everyone is a very good entire obviously if you got knocked down and the opponent is trying to place you on wake up say something like this is your Invincible reversal and what's really good about this is that you can pack in an extra hits right obviously it takes an extra stock but this is like 20 out of a like a wake up reversal or even accessories jumping at you and you want to get secures around this is these this is decent damage for an anti-air right this is very good a surround Ender type of move right now next up we're gonna talk about his ashore stacking and I want to get a different character for this one because there is some interesting applications for the short second move the shortest tackle is a move it's a two mortar uh Luke will do the initial Rush right and then you can do a punch or kick and depending on it uh the follow-up will be different uh this let's not do that Blanca right so you can go for the punch or you can go for the kick and the kick is an overhead uh obviously the kick is unsafe on block so you don't really want to do that two minus eight point blank you're gonna get punished uh the shoulder the rush into punch it's actually surprisingly safe like from the full screen distance you can kind of space this one to be safe and uh like obviously if I don't wave but yeah especially like almost full screen distance if you hit at the table like that you'll pretty much be safe right so this is a way that you can use it but obviously very susceptible to drive impact so you don't want to do that um what you want to use this move for is pretty much combos uh like if you happen to get a heavy Bunch combo into the shoulder sets up a really good Oaky situation uh if you ever get like the medium knuckle perfect knuckle just set up a situation where you get to juggle into the shoulder this all is obviously pretty good as well and uh there are some juggle situations where you can get like um flip like this very specific combo and this also does set up a good Oaky situation uh some look players love to use this on wake up a sort of a mix-up but it's not that good now what's interesting about this move is the EX version right the X version is good because if you happen to use it in combos you can cancel into level 2 silver right so you can get something like that and that does a pretty good Corner Curry again there will be a combo section at the end but what I love about this move is that it got a hit of armor and this can be used to go and fight moves like blank as blankable right foreign if you see the move coming you can kind the armor through and get decent punishes on him this also work against moves like uh Honda Etc attacking Moves In general if you happen to get the read you can use a forward advancing armor and then get follow-ups on that right it's a very specific Tech but it's ones that I've been using a lot against Blanca Honda and these type of characters now finally let's talk about his flash Knuckles right because his flash Knuckles are pretty much the core of Luke and is what you're gonna be doing the most obviously got light medium and heavy Knuckles and light will come from light attacks and the medium will come from medium attacks and the heavy will combo from heavy attacks the heavy one knocks down it's pretty all right knock down but if you want to get pressure out of it uh you want to use Drive Rush right now what's really vital about this move or the outlook's ability to charge them right obviously if you're having to do hold the button and fully charge it look will do a powered version uh this is a regular knuckle powered up knuckle launches opponent and obviously you can follow up juggle afterwards right this is kind of the point if you have watched anything look you probably know about this but there is a perfect charge right man when it's a perfect and this is a purple spark and perfect pretty much gives you a an enhanced version how do you get the perfect timing notice Luke's arm uh like notice that his arm are blowing and when they are glowing the brightest you want to let go of zapoto that is pretty much the trick to it um with some practice you will get the hang of this it is not terribly difficult but with some practice you will get the hang of this now what's really vital to know is that out of crouching heavy Bunch you can either get a fully charged knuckle and this is easy if you just want to go for easy combos or you can get the perfect knuckle and this will allow you to follow up into big combos because perfect knuckle you then drive Rush afterwards and get like a crouching heavy Bunch into the medium knuckle right this is probably one of his best combo rules now medium Knuckles are perfect charge it's also really important to learn because fully charging medium knuckle will not combo from Crouching heavy munch right notice this wasn't a combo you have to get crouching heavy ones into the perfect nugget here I missed it right crouching heavy much into perfect medium Knuckles this gives you the wall bounce and gives you a ton of damage right there is no grounded ways that you can get uh they have fully charged heavy one as far as I know but you can get it in some juggle situation they all give you better combos they all give you better damage again you will find a combo section at the end and I have done a specific video dedicated to just getting the perfect knuckle I will leave a link to it in the comment below what is finally left for Luke or his ex Knuckles and this is pretty much a combo extension if you're good with your perfect Knuckles chances are you will only need this if you're comboing from the light once right from Crouching light Bunch this is the only time you might really need ex Knuckles otherwise just if you want to take in a little bit of damage now what's good about this is that if you press like punches again you can do as a follow-up here and just follow up typically does a lot of damage like let's say I did E it's not going into an uppercut this is 1600 but if I did the knuckle into the follow-up this is 2400 so if you just wanna secure a ton of damage really quickly bam DDT sick looking move very easy did a ton of damage but obviously you're losing out on drive before I move over into his supers I wanted to quickly talk about his most probably niche special and that is the air knuckle because this move is very very specific you want to use it in very specific situations one of them like say for example the opponent knocks you in the corner and you're trying to press you but let's say Blanca is doing something like this right I can't wake up and then go for a heavy knuckle aerial knuckle and I got away uh they have to be ready for it to be able to punish it if the opponent is also in the air and you haven't to hit a jumping medium punch it puts him in Jungle State and you can juggle the air knuckle uh this also works after a light punch perfect right this is sort of a combo and there is some follow-ups here uh you might want to use it as a sort of like a neutral tool outfit neutral jump right but I don't really like this application but it is possible like because it hits really low to the grounds so you can kind that she's the opponent with that also obviously that is risky other than that there isn't that much utility to just move outside of some very specific combos so there isn't that much that you do with this one alright so let's quickly go over Luke's super moves because they're really good in my opinion among one of the very best in the game I said that his level 1 super is ridiculous and it totally is right this is six frame startup uh goes about two-thirds of the screen and because a projectile it makes it a really good answer to Fireballs right he's throwing the hadouken bam the startup and the range and the fact this is super that's a projectile means that it will collide with other Fireballs beats them and punish not many character Gods level 1 anti-fire rule supers this is very unique to Luke right obviously if I do it too late I'll still get hit so you have to be careful it's not Invincible to projectiles but you want to catch the fireball with your Superior startup and range that's kind of the idea and what's really good about it is it can be used to banish a ton of stuff right upon a jump in full screen bam you're having to get the hit uh let's stop him from jumping let's say uh like Kane waved a heavy kick stuff right everyone super it's also very easy to combo into any time you get like a launch or knock him like a light Knuckles that is perfect otherwise just combo into level one super even getting like an ex flash muscle and you will combo into God Target combos like me like heavy and you can combo into it or even just double millions and you will get it so it does a lot of damage it's very fast it's also Invincible unwelcome so let's say for example here Kane is gonna try to breast us on wake up I can wake up with my living room super fully Invincible bam knock him away and I have a lot of distance to work with this is this happening like it's a don't get better than that for the living consumer it's pretty ridiculous now his level 2 super is also invincible so you can kind of use it in the same wake up situation right but I don't love losing it that way what is special about his level 2 super is the corner carry right so whenever you get like a flash knuckle medium knuckle and you get some wall bounce you can always come more into the ex uh one shoulder right I was really good about that is the extra shoulder will combo into his little too soon and this will give you a lot of corner this is primarily what you want to use this for Corner carry and give you a ton of damage and now uh you get to throw Loop them right so in that application I like it otherwise I don't and I don't recommend using it as an invincible reversal since you got level 1 super already unless it's gonna kill you right now finally he have the level three and level 3 is good because it's an anti-fireable super uh it's not that fast at full frame so it's not the best anti-verbal sugar but it works and it's a pretty easy one to combo into unfortunately you can't overcut into Super This Will Never Land but you can get like a light knuckle into it and this will always work leave your nothing into it or maybe nothing into each work and even shoulder into it uh this works as well right so it's an easy level three to combo into a lot of utility and it does pretty good damage obviously in level 3's in general are very good in this game and it leaves you in a good situation right at plus 18 at resistance you can immediately follow up with a heavy Bunch or like a forward heavy bunch and go from there and that is pretty much it for look well-rounded character got an answer for everything reversal defense is good zoning is good and tires are good the pressure is amazing Corner career and damage supers everything is pretty amazing loses character it's very well-rounded and very very solid if you have enjoyed this video please leave a like or a comment it helps our channel so much it will be leaving
