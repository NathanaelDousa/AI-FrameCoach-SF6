let's get it space trap is when you make your opponent feel like you're at a disadvantage which makes your opponent Counterattack and it whiffs due to ambiguous spacing this is like a frame trap except a frame trap you lower your opponent into a Counterattack due to ambiguous frame Advantage one of my favorite quotes from The Art of War by sunu is all Warfare is based on Deception when we are near we must make the enemy believe we are far when we are far away we must make them believe we are near deception is one of the strongest strategies you could use so let me show you how to appear near when you're actually are let me teach you about space traps to set up any trap you have to have the right bait to have the right bait you need to know what you want a trap an example of a space trap is a situation that most jury players know about as a jury does a light fua and it's blocked she's minus four this means any attack that's four frames or quicker will punish the light fua but if I'm able to use a combo and push myself out obviously the light attack would whiff which will cause a situation where the opponent is trapped and they get hit by the next attack this is a basic idea of what a frame trap is it's very important to know what your opponent wants to do so you can bait prop l in this case here your opponent should know you're pretty far away and the light attack would whiff they're more likely to throw out a long range attack to make sure that they can connect with you even if they don't get the punish you're minus so their next attack should beat you out but if you see your opponent wants to throw out this crouching medium kick instead of doing the fua you can throw out the crouching medium kick at max range forcing the retaliation crouching medium kick to whiff the goal is to use something that's disadvantaged or punishable and to make your opponent feel safe in retaliation but we're using deception and we're able to Beta response so that we can take as much damage as we possibly can away from them and if you like the video make sure to like And subscribe to see more content like this so let's look at a few situations that come up often jury standing hard kick is a powerful tool often it's used in a way that if you use a light attack or most medium punches their attack would whiff and they would be put in a situation where they would take a lot of damage but most characters that have low medium kicks will use that attack afterwards because it will reach the opponent because even pretty far away you can still connect low medium kick on top of it trying to walk backwards after the crouching medium kick is not advised because then we'll get hit low using a crouching block will also make us bigger so it's easier for him to hit that crouching medium kick because of the risk reward it's highly incentivized for Ken to use this attack but that is the bait now that we know what Ken wants to do we should go out of our way to make it so that his retaliation crouching medium kick will whiff this will leave him open to bigger damage there is something important to notice if I use standing hard kick and don't press anything the crouching medium kick will whiff if I use standing hard kick and block low it will whiff if I use standing hard kick and hit hard punch afterwards it will whiff standing Hard Punch is 10 frame startup but if I use forward medium punch which is eight frame start up which technically it's quicker you notice we get hit so it's important also to consider hit boxes and hurt boxes as well as whether the move moves forward or not and there are sometimes where if you mash your Counterattack you'll get hit so in the case of forward medium punch if we mash the for forward medium punch we get hit but if we wait for the whiff we can get the punish so getting used to using your standing hard kick in ranges where retaliation with whiff is super important because if we stand inside we're forced to Parry now if we spend a lot of time not spacing our standing hard kick correctly and crouching medium kick retaliation connects this is also part of the Trap because Ken could feel safe into using it and we could be ready for it so we should be creative and think about ways to make that standing hard kick work for us if you think about the situation you're in and how your opponent might want to Counterattack to your standing hard kick you can come up with some creative situations here's a common occurrence in the Aki vers jury matchup after drivve rush hard kick jury is plus one which means if Aki tries to throw out an attack she'll be hit so a lot of times I'll use this string to stay safe if I were to use the light fua the light fua would whiff so I'll use the medium fua so that it connects typically this is fine in most cases because the light attack will whiff however Aki standing medium punch is 6 frames and medium fua on block is minus six frames so even though I'm decently far away she can still punish from that range personally I like using standing medium kick because it pushes the opponent out in the case of Drive Rush hard kick and then medium kick look how far away we are so if Aki tries using standing medium punch after the hard kick I can use standing medium kick to beat her out and if she tries to use a light attack standing medium kick will trade and if they block both of them and try to use standing medium punch it'll whiff once your opponent starts to respect this situation and you punish them hard they'll be more likely to not hit a button in this case here and if if they don't press a button after the hard kick we can use something heavier we started talking about this because Aki wants to use standing medium punch after a medium fua but if Aki's not going to press a button after this hard kick we can use this hard kick medium punch light fua to bait out the medium punch again we know the bait that they want to use medium punch after medium fua so if we set the bait we can exploit this let's talk about Funway engine common issue with jury is if you end your combos with a store even the light one you're still in range of crouching medium kick I wanted to find a trap so that Cammy couldn't reversal crouching medium kick and connect with me I know I can't use medium fua cuz it pushes me forward I have to be far enough so that it pushes me far away but close enough so that the light fua actually connects close enough so that the light fua connects but out of range on the crouching medium kick so the fua is the Trap I just need to set up the bait this is the sequence I came up with now just like the first case if I block low it connects this is one of the sequences I came up with if Cammy tries to press a button after the medium punch Cammy will get hit and if Cammy tries to press a button anytime afterwards they'll get hit but after we get to this point in the sequence everything after that is a block string so if I set Cammy to press the button after the forward medium punch even if she goes to hit a button she can't because it's a block string this sequence works in the mid screen one of the things I don't like about this sequence is the gap in between medium punch and light kick this is a defense point so the enemy could Mash through it this sequence here is frame tight but if you look the crouching medium kick does connect and if she tries to mash OD Cannon Spike you can't because there's technically no space to do so so that solves one problem but it doesn't solve the fact that crouching medium kick still connects this is a corner setup if they try to use crouching medium kick in the corner it whiffs they also can't match DP this is a sequence that we can use in the corner to SPAC trop something to take note of after a safe jump if you use this jump in and use this setup the life wuab will whiff the way that we fix this is after the jump and we take just a small step forward and then and everything works and if you're concerned about someone mashing an attack on you like here after the safe jump you're still plus enough to walk forward a few frames and still get the setup so the last thing I wanted to talk about is jury's strengths in her long reaching attacks but also her weakness to her long reaching attacks you see jury's attacks do have Long Reach but with that Long Reach comes punishability if you whiff any of these buttons in correctly you could be punished really hard for it for you so you don't want to whiff any of these attacks but you also want to space yourself so that they can't Counterattack as well I say this because a few pixels could be the difference between a win or a loss it also allows you to be creative without a bunch of flowchart setups that your opponent could catch on to and deny you if you're able to take note of patterns from your opponent you can show your opponent something that is true it's not your turn and she can attack first you could tell them that truth and then use deception to make them second guess whether or not what they see is right if your opponent has a pattern then your opponent can be exploited whenever you're strong you want to appear weak because your opponent will strike when they feel that you're weak and that's when you show your true strength you want your opponent to feel like they're close cuz when they feel that you're close they'll strike and if you're far when they think you're close you can Counterattack and crush them I always believe jury is an artist's character if you have the vision you can create but the art that you create uses the color palette of deception and with deception you can always create something beautiful if you like this video make sure to like And subscribe and if
