Kimberly is a fast tricky character who uses her unique movement options to get in perform ambiguous Mix-Ups once she is close she's a great character learned for beginners or even more experienced players as she's easy to pick up but has tons of death to explore I'm one of the highest ranked Kimberly and have played super well in a couple tournaments and I want to pass on my learnings to help you learn the character time stamps below let's get started now I I'm going to make this pretty comprehensive right because I think knowledge is power in any type of fighting game and in order to fully understand Kimberly you have to understand the B first which we're going to talk about our normals but then we'll go on specials combos strategy and whatnot let's start with Kimberly's Jabs her Crouch L punch is her fastest normal at four frames and it's used to either Mash out of block strings or to punish certain things right on normal hit you can get anything at the Target combo you can also do jab jab jab into core Circle forward punch sometimes you'll also need to use this to punish like a minus four move and what you can do is this actually links into stand medium kick and you can get something like that but mainly this is your this is your Mash out button now your stand jab it's a little bit slower but you get a way better knockdown off of it right because this doesn't really give you a knockdown so in general you want to you want to go into this target combo and now she has three Target combos from her jab and pretty much anytime you're doing standing jab you want to hit confirm into a Target combo so you can do light medium and this will actually like make you safe and then if you notice that the target combo hit you can go into you can dial in whatever Target combo you want now there's three Target combos if you're midscreen you always want to go into the late medium heavy heavy Target combo now she has two other variations where you hit down and heavy first the target combo ending with a throw you always want to do when you're near the corner because it'll Sid swap them into the corner and the corner is super important in Street Fighter because they can't back up and you get really dirty mixups from that right so you're pretty much only doing this when you uh when you will put them in the corner now the third tier combo interesting you pretty much only use this for advanced combos because you see you kick them pretty far away and you generally want to stay close to your opponent I mean we'll go over this later but you see it's like used in jugle combos like this all right now light kick again Crouch light kick is your low option Kimberly does have good mix between high low because this is an overhead so you can use this to mix up I also like this after like an empty jump or a Teleport because it this can be really tricky to block and Crouch leg kick is your your fast to slow to combo after Crouch kick just go into crou L punch into the combo of your choice now stand L kick it's interesting normal um you don't really use it up close I personally think um the best use of this is just to like throw it out of neutral cuz it it has more range than uh St light punch and so you can kind of like buffer a stand light kick into into this the other thing you can do that's really strong is you can press stand light kick and then forward forward and if they run into it here we go you get Drive rush and you get a full combo off this here we go so medium punch Crouch medium punch this is a combo filler it's also really good combo starter because this Crouch medium punch links in the stand medium punch right so you're mostly doing this when you want to link in the stand me punch this is minus on block so if you just Auto dial this in they can jab in between so you have to be a little bit careful but this is this is really strong stand medium punch goes into a Target combo so it's just medium heavy and this leads into whatever so one of our basic bread and butters is just you know crou Med punch stand medum punch into whatever follow up generally I don't like doing this on block because a lot of characters can like just jab you or DP for free afterwards so I like to try to hit confirm something like this and then if I see the medium punch didn't hit then I don't go in but on hit you can get whatever fall up you want I like run but sometimes you also want to do slide after this obviously you can like Drive rush and do you know fancy comos too all let's talk about minium kick crash medium kick now this medium Kick's very special because a lot of characters have a cancelable medium kick crash medium kick is not cancelable the benefit is that it's plus Crouch me kick also makes a really good meting because it's plus one block so you get combo on counter hit look something like that because it's only plus one on block you do have to hit Crouch jab if you hit anything else they'll be able to mash out I also like this a lot after Drive rush because you're like super plus after you do that all right C me kick this is a very similar an applic to stand leg kick it's just a poke you can kind of throw out and it's really good if you cancel in the drive rush and then you get you know nice combos you can also special cancel this too but generally if I'm looking for Drive Rush confirm generally that's why I'm doing a stand beam kick as like the most range out of your cancelable normals so even has more range than like stand heavy punch you know throw it out when you want that additional range all right so stand heavy punch this is your punish counter starter of choice this is also your best shimmy normal so what does that me mean so for example if they are mashing throw and you can call that you can read that throw you get really good damage right so you can get something like that you can you know choose the Ender of your choice on that combo they all do pretty similar damage the other reason why you want to use this for shimmy let's say they don't actually bite this is actually pretty good to cancel from this will be anything slower than a four frame so this this will lose to a four frame but let's say they are just mashing for frame there's I mean there's a lot of cool stuff you can do you can just do five heavy punch and stand medium kick you can do five heavy punch it another five heavy punch there's a lot of ways you can bait the opponent from mashing right so even if they block your shimmy attempt you still have a lot of cool options you can do on Block to continue your pressure all right now Crouch heavy punch this is your antire it's one of the best anti normals in the game because a lot of anies you don't get um a good situation but for Kimberly you can choose whether to go left right and get a full combo I like to go for Crouch medium kick there but you can also go for Crouch medium punch uh you have a lot of different options there the whole point is you get a 50/50 after you anti them the other benefit to crouch heavy punch is as the most blocks on the any normal so take for example doing Crouch heavy punch into run stop this will beat any normal on block including your Crouch jab the other cool thing you can do with Crouch heavy punch is you can cancel an ex run stop and your Plus on block and you can go for a Crouch jab to basically poke out anything else they can do my favorite way to land Crouch heavy punch is to do it during a drive Rush so for example this sequence grants you a full combo because you are plus after the run stop now the interesting thing is there's certain moves that will put you into like a state where you can get a Juggle after Crouch heavy punch so take for example this move from Kimberly if you anti this of Crouch heavy punch you get a full combo so you see how this says forc knockdown right here if you get a forced knockdown you get uh a Juggle point which means you can go into your combo of choice this is pretty much the optimal and then you can do whatever followup you want after this right that's like a third of their health just for getting anti tied it's absolutely insane so as long as you time your Crouch heavy punches right you can get you can be very rewarded for it so heavy kick you actually have four different moves that go off of us so stand heavy kick this is like a very good pressure button after like a knockdown a main advantage is this is plus un block which means that if they match just like Crouch medium kick you get a full combo the other benefit is that if this hits you get nice juicy damage after you going to link a stand medium punch after into whatever followup you want this s is very good um a lot characters have a really hard time punishing this this also goes very far so it's your farthest reaching move slightly further in Stand medium kick but the main advantage is that you get a knockdown right so in order to get a knockdown for this you generally have to spend bar or you have to like do something that's like kind of unsafe but this if you space it right it's safe and you get a knockdown you can start your your fun on offense right now she has two command normals off the heavy kick she has this back and heavy punch heavy kick it's a overhead um just like all overheads it's plus if it hits it's minus if it's blocked Kimberly's special in that she gets a uh Crush jab afterwards it'll [Music] combo it's also really good used uh Drive rush because you can get whatever combo you choose now this is her Ford heavy kick this is probably like her most interesting normal now this Ford heavy kick has a few different follow-ups you can jump back you can jump up or you can jump forward these all have uses right um if if you just want to be safe you can jump back it's really hard for the opponent to to catch that right now A really common response is to jab after right now if you like let's say you jump forward the jab hits you get a force knockdown so they actually get a combo there so if you're afraid that you can just jump back if you think they're going to block probably the best thing you can do is just go for a crossup because this is really really tricky to block so this makes a really good crossup mixup now the other underrated option here is you don't have to actually do a jump this is actually safe on block so this is really good and you can play you can like try to perfect Parry the jab that's really strong it makes like a guessing game the best thing you can do if you're fighting a Kimberly just perfect Parry the forward heavy kick and then you can get a punish but um on block you kind of have to you have to guess so down forward me K this is slide it's pretty unsafe so if you missp it you get punished cared and you just die right now if you space it perfectly like here you can't get punished and you can always play Parry mind games or whatever you want to do on hit you don't really get much either like even if I'm like spaced out like this I can't get a combo and if I'm like here I I can still be punished or I can at least be minus Now by if you have the tip you get a punish and just like anything else in this game if you get a punish if this punish counters then you get a combo into whatever you want all right air normals now I'm going to make this easy for you jump jab not that useful jump light kick it's a crossup but to be honest I almost always use jump medium kick but you can also use jump light kick I think it's a little bit better um jump medium punch it's uh very good air to air you'll also be using in combos jump heavy punch this probably like this decent it forces a knockdown I don't really use it that much right now heavy kick I think is is probably her best jumping so most of the time with Kimberly I'm using either using J medium kick for cross up or J heavy kick for uh a jump in now you also have this elbow this elbow is very good it's minus on block so um they can actually jab you after but it's really tricky because at a certain range like here you can do cross up or you can do non-ross up and it's it's really difficult to block let's say you're trying to like bait the antire you can do this and it'll bait the antire and then you can you know whiff punish it all right let's talk about her specials um the most notorious one is her run so the run you can do with any kick button they're all the same and the followup is what's different right so you can do light kick this is a plus unblock move it's also really really good for uh anti so let's say like someone's just neutral jumping midc screen you can get command grab into whatever you want right now the slide is very good it's obviously unsafe but it's really good to like punish a projectile this goes under Fireballs it's also like kind of a jump scare it's really really fast this is one of the reason Kimberly is quite good against zoners is because you can you can just throw this out there and once you get them conditioned then you can start going to the overhead this this heavy kick fall up is the overhead you can literally just like keep looping it like this it's also safe on block so don't be too afraid to just just throw it out there of course all of our special moves have EX version ex run is pretty similar um like this is a little bit does a little bit more damage ex stop is like it stops a little bit quicker so this you can actually do and you can get a combo from like St heavy punch so this is uh this is pretty strong this is like just useful in combos I don't think I don't think you'd ever just throw this out the uh light kick version of EX it has some use in like really Tech like Advanced Combos and the uh overhead I'm not going to lie I don't think I've ever used this there overhead but I guess it would technically be like pretty good from like a s heavy punch just to like keep it a little bit more tight and now the Run also you don't always have to follow it up if you don't follow it up like you just Let It Rock you're going to get this animation right this animation is pretty good you can do two follow-ups you can do a kick follow up or a punch follow up that's a command grab this is kind of gimmicky they can beat both options just by walking back and then they get a full punish right so you don't really want to do that move unless you're in the corner so if they walk back in the corner sorry it hits so um yeah only do the fall UPS in the corner the good thing is is that this is this is safe on block right so you don't have to really worry about getting punished and you have like a really good spacing for Kim where you can like Drive rush back in or you can jump or that sort of thing now the EX version it has a couple advantages so if this hits you get a wall Splat in the corner and then you get a followup whatever you want um this is the most common one you also get a uh combo Alpha after the punch version but same idea you get forward heavy kick into this into whatever you want right so there's a lot of different options and the goal of Kimberly again is just to mix up these options and be be unpredictable I keep saying that throughout this guide because a lot of these have counters but if you're really unpredictable it makes Kimberly very hard to deal with speaking of we have teleport now there's only two versions of teleport all the punch versions are all the same for teleport the cool thing about this is one you can get in you can like skip projectiles for example the issue with this is that the opponent can just react so if you just see the teleport and then I can I can jab I can get a punch counter into whatever I want so you have to be really unpredictable with it another spot I really like this is let's say I'm doing like a block string right and one thing that's really annoying is like people will jab back and one of the ways I like to beat jab back is like I'll do uh I'll do a jab and I'll cancel that into a Teleport and now make the jab wh right and you can do that from pretty much like any of your any of her normals that are minus as long as you space it out properly now the ex is really good one reasons this really good is because again people like the Crouch jab so this also beats if you space it correctly this will beat Crouch jaab this is really hard to deal with on reaction because you can't just jab it you have to DP or you have to do a slower normal to hit her out of the air your best option is stay L punch but again that that can be really tricky to like react to hey YouTube diaphone post production here which if you made it this far consider like share and subscribing helps out the channel helps us make more content like this to help you guys learn Street Fighter 6 or other fighting games in the future I had to change this part of the guy the Tatu so this Tatu used to be a pretty good anti-air if you do it really late it's no longer it basically has no air invincibility right so if you're going to do as a antire you have to do it super early I recommend pretty much always doing it the heavy version if you're going to do a reactive antire now there's a couple other ways you can use this so mostly as like a combo filler so for example Jack jab medium Tatsu Works jab jab light Tatu works I generally never use l Tatsu outside of this combo in the corner where you do light Tatu and juggles you can actually use medium Tatu here too but I find it sometimes drops and it's not worth the extra little bit of damage that you get because if you drop it then you just die right now the ex Tatu used to be Invincible it's no longer invincible so you have to be a little careful how you use it so for example you're never going to win use it on knockdown but it does have some purpose because it does have some head invol which makes us a really good anti-air so for example this will work you can do it super super late and it's always going to work it's also really good against characters like Cammy where it's like if you do regular Tatu on reaction to the dive kick it's not going to work but if you do ex Tatu it's going to work every time provided you know I actually get it out so you also have air Tatu um this mainly for combos doesn't really matter too much what you do I use the heavy kick version this is like more advanced Tech but you can do immediate Tatu like this but it wh on crouching so you might be like oh this is kind of useless right well not really and this is something I'm actually working to implement into my game right now you can use this to punish throws which is like way too cool right so you don't really have the best options to punish throw but this is a option that that will punish so it's just a little hard to do oh we also have this elbow only used for combos they're all unsafe you don't want to just throw them out jab jab jab is your light version your medium versions like good after stand medium kick is also a couple jungle Combos and then the heavy punch version is only after this you can also use the ex ex is very good after like anytime you use the uh medium punch version not in a jungle and then you get a Juggle like that after okay so a couple more specials we have the paint can you get two they carry over between rounds so if you win a around and you only have one pink can you're going to keep one pink can light medium heavy you have three versions they go different distance so in the corner you may think they're all the same well they're actually not because the the heavy version explodes a little bit slower than the medium which explodes a little bit slower than the low the explosion is small so I don't like to do I never throw them in neutral but some Kim players do like to throw them where I think it has Merit is in the corner so anytime you get a slide knockdown or you get a ex Tatu knockdown you can throw a paint can and then you can do a mixup and there's a lot of cool mixups we'll go over that later you also have EX version it throws both not that useful except for like uh combos right once you have zero cans you can actually reload the can by doing the same motion down down and punch and if you want to reload both cans at once you can do down down two punches and you get both cans back all right her other special is air grab so all the air grab versions are the same um it's mostly used for combos you can use this anti-air too it's really f I don't like to do it because I feel like I try to do it because your reward so high especially off of ex but you know people I'll just get hit out and that'll be really sad same thing with regular gra command grab you can do it um but mostly you're just using this in combos so here's an example of a a combo that you use reg now you have three supers um Kimberly super routing I think is very straight forward right your level one's Invincible it's cor CLE forward twiice with kicks the main time you're going to use this is like a level one reversal like if you're just trying to get out of the corner or you're in Burnout and you need a reversal sometimes you can do this if it'll kill um but it's only cancelable from normal so like let's say you get this situation and you don't actually get that much more you get a little bit more damage you know that's 2700 that's pretty good but even just like a basic confirm like this you're only getting 800 more damage so only do that if it kills the other thing is it also wastes a paint can too and your paint cans are very valuable level two it's the same thing I pretty much only do it if it kills and the main way you're going to hit confirm into this is after any air ex Tatu um ex moves are level two cancelable and then you can go into level two but the level three I think it's where it's at I personally believe that unless you're like super up and around you should always do the level three and the main reason is when you do the super you'll see this little icon here and this little icon indicates a buff is active and the buff lasts the whole match and you get a damage buff and you get a speed buff so Kimberly actually walks faster now which is really really nice and you get 10% damage buff too and it's also like if you have level three you don't really want to sit on the meter because you're not building any extra meter so it's kind of like a meter economy thing too where you always want to be using your meter and like you can literally win off of a level three because like let's say you get a confirm like this like the one this does like half their health but two if you look at their Drive uh Drive gauge this does like a half a bar and a half a drive gauge and so if they're already low you can put them really close to burnout and then it's like one more mix it can be burned out is very very poent all right so combos now Kimberly has a ton of combos but I want to like distill this into like the few combos as a beginner that you should learn now the first combo you should learn is your DP punish combo combo this is your basic punch you can do L teleport or you can do a run stop the run stop is a lot harder so if you're new just go do the light teleport stand heavy kick into Target combo into run and then that's that's your basic combo I mean ideally you're punishing with uh Drive Impact but it's really hard like I just missed it there we're in training mode anytime you hit a stand heavy kick it's just the same version of the combo now you have two different Enders here you can go into this run which I like to do Drive Rush Oki so you can do like a a drive Rush after or just go in the slide now this is way better in the corner because you get a mey can but you can also do it midscreen and then you just get a dash up into you know throw or whever you want to do the same situation happens if you hit a Crouch medium punch it's the same exact situation you go into that another place this combo routing Works after a drive impact again stand heavy kick into your target combo pretty straightforward the second basic combo you need to know is comboing in the Target combo right anytime you hit a Crouch tab try to go into the stand jab into this target combo very useful and then you just Dash up and you get uh you get a mixup um this is a very common situation where you'll be doing like jab jab or like jab that do a punish make sure you're learning that the rest are a little more Nuance now this is a very common situation you hit drive impact in the corner um what I like to do is Crouch heavy punch punch into the 236 run light kick followup you can go for a straight air throw um the other thing you can do here Crouch heavy punch 236 LK and then heavy Tatsu now if you're near the corner after like a situation like this you never want to do this you always want to go into run assuming you have a can and when you do the run into slide throw the uh the mey bomb and then you have a few different options here I'm going to talk about this is your most basic one where you just Mash throw after and it beats almost anything they can do besides just teching now you get EX command grab after and this air ex command grab is really important to learn the combo after it's really basic right do ex command grab and you do the juggle and that's that's the most basic jugle you can get we're going to talk about strategy and then we're going to go into Advance stuff we'll cover that okay so let's talk about strategy the most important thing about this character now if I can give you a few guiding words for this character it's be random I know that sounds like kind of scrubby I know that sounds like thing you're not supposed to do but the more random you are the harder it is going to be for the opponent to counter you right now you have a lot of different options that you want to throw out a neutral right you have sweep you have Ford heavy kick you have Drive Impact you have teleport you have ex tele Port Drive rush so you want to make sure you're rotating all those options now I think one of the best things you can do in this game and it's it's very strong it's just drive rushing and neutral so let's say they don't have a fireball or you've conditioned them not to throw a fireball because you're jumping at them or because you're you know you're teleporting right you get them to sit still that's the goal is cimberly you want to get them to sit still and then your goal is to drive rush in now you have a few different options from Drive rush you can either do a jab like if you think they're going to like try to beat your drive Rush with a button generally Drive Rush jab is like almost impossible to stop on reaction right the other thing you can do is you can do Drive Rush Crouch medium kick and again with Drive Rush every single thing that you do gets more uh hit stun than block stun so situation I like to do really frequently is I'll do Drive rush crou medium kick and to stand heavy punch and if you do this right it Combos and whatever combo you want right now let's say this is blocked right you have a few different options you can just me crck in the throw you can do let's say now they're teching your grab well with Kimberly the best thing I like to do is just walk back stand heavy punch and remember this first combo that I said I need to you guys to learn it's the same exact thing you just go through that and you punish the grab and this is the basis of Kim's offense right so once you get that knockdown you can repeat the same situation you know Crouch me kick in the throw into oh okay I just get to Loop this over and over and then you go for a throw you can go go for another throw and you just keep steamrolling right once you get this initial hit whether it's from a throw or it's from something else you don't let your opponent mesh out the main thing I recommend doing this is like set the opponent to wake up reversal here and set him to wake up reversal Crouch stab and at low levels this is what people are going to be doing and it's really easy to be at high levels but you just need to get the timing down so take any knockdown for example now let's say I M time a throw I get hit right but in Street Fighter as long as you time everything right it's easy you counter hit them they take a lot of damage now now throws a little harder to stop right because they can back roll but the one thing you can do is again instant Drive rush and punish that MH and this will if you can get that down you'll you'll destroy beginner players they literally either have to reversal or they have to take a mix so once you get that down again the whole goal of Kimberly is in neutral you get that knockdown and then you make those knockdowns really count by either going through a throw or going for a uh a strike or going for a shimmy right and you keep rotating those options till they're dead a couple other things that I think are really important in neutral 2o just to comprehend is doing like uh elbow drop in neutral very very good make sure you rotating that in random slide against Fireballs really strong once you start doing this stuff it'll work for a while and then you'll probably get to people that like seem like they're shutting everything down and at that point I think it's important just to like play a a little bit more patient turn down like the yolon cuz I think I think a lot of Kimberly like at low level this will be like really effective if someone's just down backing and waiting for you to do stuff and they're just like punishing all your slides or they're just punishing all your jumps one stop doing it so predictably but two this opens up Drive Rush this opens up just Dash up throw you just poking at them opens up you spacing some sweeps I would say play nutty and if the opponent is patient do things that punish punish that patience right yeah you can do Run Stop people will like Drive Impact this on reaction you can run stop throw you can run stop block see what they do don't try to play this character like a traditional neutral character because you're going to have a bad time if you're just trying to like whiff punish with st medium kick and shimmy back and forth you can do that but you don't want to make that your main game plan because other characters can do this better than you right a couple other notes on offense JB pressure is quite good you can special cancel this into this you can special can on the ex you can whiff punish and then go into stand heavy punch but yeah seriously with Kim throw a lot throws are really really cheap in this game if you ever get a throw in the corner you can just Dash forward and throw them and they literally have to Tech or reversal out and on defense I really can't give that much advice use the basic mechanics right Drive Parry if they're ever going for like a like a high low mixup or occasionally throw it out there just to get Drive gauge just block don't be afraid to take the throw don't be afraid to the jump out as well you don't have the best jump out but remember you can mix up with this and so if they're like spacing themselves a little bit this can be really really tricky to deal with if you ever think they're going to shim me jump outs really strong against that too so if you're if you're learning Kimberly right practice the combos make sure you have the combos down practice the execution make sure that your opponent can't Mash on you on wake up make sure you utilize all of her moves and get practice in don't learn too many optimal combos just start playing online and get get a feel for how all of her moves work that's the most important thing you can do instead of staying in the lab uh and learning a bunch of stuff and that brings us to advaned section talk about staying in the lab and learning a bunch of stuff once you get all that stuff down you're going to want to learn more to do with Kimberly right and there's a lot let's talk about some of the stuff that I think is uh is really important with her um the first one being Oki so again anytime you get um the slide or this or this target combo you get immedi bomb so that means you just throw a bomb and then they can't Mash out of it so take for example you they can't Mash out and now the first thing I think you should always do is throw after right it's it's the easiest it beats mash it um forces them to take action it beats some reversals actually too yeah and make sure I use heavy bomb for everything but you get this conversion if you want to go into level three go uh uh elbow in the super now once you have them conditioned the tech there's a few things you can do right so I'll set the opponent to wake up throw so same knockdown send the wake up throw and if I go for grab it just tchs and you don't want that right so what we can do is back dash and make the throw Whip and you can go for ex knock down like that so you just do stand me kick in that situation they're not going to throw on wake up they're going to do a delay throw so that actually punish counter and then you get a full combo there the other thing you can do and this will actually make some reversals whiff too you so you can do immediate elbow drop you and then you can go into whatever combo you want let's say this punish counters so here's an example of something you can do right punish counter into these Loops so anytime you get that really Airborne 236 LK you can go into these Drive Rush loops and again I wouldn't burn myself out if it wouldn't kill but you can do the first portion of that and then save the rest of the drive meter and you get a very good very good reward off of um them mash and grab right another option that that people are doing is um especially if you want to stop Mash I'll do Target [Music] combo into a slide and then that combos so again this is another option and then you get you know the same combo that you get after all the other stuff so between Ro those four options that' be really good I've seen some other people do like this they'll do like into to teleport I don't really like that stuff that much the mix up's not as true as the throw stuff one other thing I want to show you guys is basically what I was showing you is Drive Rush combo so there's a few situations um like you want to use Drive Rush mainly the the cancel out so let's say you get like a situation like this right you can like blow all your meter on something like this now I there's something a little more technically can do anytime I get a St heavy punch I go for this route where I'll do core Circle forward heavy and then I'll Dy rush into this target combo and I'll go for a um followup right now there's a few other things you can do too um again this takes a lot of practice it's it's a little tough I won't recommend to beginners but another thing you can do is you can go in the slide here and this is really good because like if you want the even though it does like quite a bit less damage you get you uh you can get the koki from like this far right and then you can go into this into everything we just talked about so that's that's really good just a few things before we close out the guide I might get the question about modern controls I didn't really cover in this guide but honestly Kimberly is very similar in modern to Classic the main thing that she loses is the Crouch medium punch so basically you don't have to really use it that much only for specific confirms and in those confirms you can just omit it so it's not really an issue um but I do recommend playing this character on classic I don't really think you get anything out of playing this character on Modern there's a lot more to this character in fact I keep finding new tech every day every day and in order to keep this guide short I didn't really include all of the stuff I know so if you want to see that you know consider following me on Twitch and Twitter where I'm doing Daily Tech postings for Kimberly Link in the description below thank you guys so much for watching like share and subscribe if
