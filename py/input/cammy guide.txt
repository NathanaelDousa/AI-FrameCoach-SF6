street Fighter 6 season 3 just came out a few weeks ago along with a bunch of balance changes Cami got changed in several ways So we're going to go through and talk about what were those changes what do they mean for season 3 and what are some of the new setups and options that you have access to now So the first change was to her standing light kick Basically the hitbox doesn't go quite as far now So remember this is a key poke punish tool neutral tool five frame startup good range but now it's just going to have slightly less range Um you can see there's kind of a magic range here where it'll start to hit Uh just get familiar with that range Now doesn't feel too different but it is going to affect those fringe situations such as uh bison scissor kicks on block This is minus five So you have to be close enough in order to punish that Uh but if I back up just a step here that's going to whiff now So just try to get familiar with that range when you can punish what you can go into and other than that it's basically the same move Next change is to heavy DP against airborne So now if it hits on active frame one or two they don't get knocked back as far So it leaves you in range to do a last frame medi stand medium punch You can also get like a crouch fierce meaty like that or you can add more of a delay if you want a gap on purpose And you can also do drive rush jab to bait DP and super And you can do like a last minute bait as well Next change is to her swing combination which is this target combo heavy punch heavy kick Three hits and that last hit is cancelellable into special super or dry brush So what they changed about it is the cancel window to go into those things is now shifted to be two frames later So for example in season 2 all the time we used to see this right medium kick spiral arrow cancel So this was used a lot because it was pretty decent damage really good corner carry about half the stage And uh after double dash you actually got a setup off of this double dash This used to be plus two so you could go for a low or throw Uh but now we're zero So what's going to happen is we do double dash we do jab and they can trade So this Okei is pretty much gone Another setup that you saw pretty often in season 2 was this cancel into medium punch hool again And then you have several options right you can do uh low there You can go for media overhead Um you can go for a bait But because of the two-frame cancel window shifting um this is now not going to hit media anymore You can see if you look at the frame meter the first active frame that pink one is the one that hits So we don't get any kind of bonus frames Before you used to be able to cancel into for example level one super here but that doesn't work Um you could also cancel into light spiral that used to juggle Doesn't work anymore So this setup is also nerfed and I would recommend going for a different one So one good option for Oki now is after medium spiral you just drive rush Holding down back you're plus 10 here to bait reversals and supers You can manually control how far you are and how plus you are by when you time that down back So here I was plus six I'm going to try to do it a little later Plus five there in or out of throw range You can choose also from this we can go into a perfect meaty strike You can see last active frame of the crouching fierce there And of course if the strike connects then you have a lot of time to confirm to get another heavy punch or whatever you want Another option we have is going straight into meaty throw from the dry rush We can also go for delayed shimmy in case they throw tech And we can also bait right spiral arrow Another effect of this change is that heavy target combo into light spiral now whiffs but it leaves you at plus six You can kind of fish for a counter hit here with standing medium punch or even standing heavy punch The corner combo with this is actually exactly the same probably because of the next change but this is light spiral into medium DP leaves us at plus 21 And we get a nice frame kill setup here with whiff jab into standing medium punch You can see it hits on the last active frame So plus nine on hit plus two on block And for the confirm I like to do another fierce And you can loop this into itself And on block I do a standing light kick because it'll frame trap them with a three-frame gap And if this medium punch connects you actually get a confirm off of that This opens up a new combo route midscreen off of back roundhouse which is dry rush heavy punch light spiral medium spiral plus 30 knockdown which leaves us at the perfect timing to do dash crouch heavy punch on the last active frame Uh the only thing about this is it has to be perfect If I hit Ryu and he's too high up that's just going to whip So it kind of has to be at the lowest possible point just like that any earlier and this is going to drop Last change which is also the biggest is light spin knuckle against airborne The knock back on it changed So this didn't seem like much at first but this actually opens up a ton of options and new setups that you can mix and match any way that you want So bear with me First thing optimal combos actually use this now So meterless you're going to do back roundhouse light knuckle heavy DP So that's 3080 Not bad Uh this is also an efficient way to cash out one meter if you want more damage and corner carry And also uh level three This is really efficient Over 5,000 damage for that Another use is in the corner off of light knuckle You can end the combo in standing heavy kick This leaves you at plus 10 in this case I think it's plus 12 if you have two of these in here Yeah So in either case uh you can mey with crouching heavy punch and that's plus eight So enough to connect another heavy punch afterwards You can go for a surprise throw as well If you want to drive rush into this route from a medium you can do crouching heavy punch into back roundhouse into light knuckle You can also use it in side switch routes like this one Here we go So a huge application for this is safe jump So we're going to do back roundhouse light knuckle And what you can do there is skip the ender lose out on some damage for this plus 56 and then we frame kill with crouching light kick Leaves us at plus 42 That's the safe jump timing So we're going to hold up after that up forward jump in with heavy punch or heavy kick And that's going to be a safe jump So I'm gonna turn on Shyukin Safe against that And also if they drive parry it then you're actually able to act because you're slightly minus here but you won't be punished by a throw or a jab like a normal perfect parry So this actually covers back roll and roll in place Uh just depends on your distance So if you're spaced out for example off of a driver's confirm here see the second place you're still same side But if I just do the same thing from point blank I cross over So it's somewhat distance dependent But if you see that you're going to cross yourself up like this you can do a jump light kick You can react to where they tech and use a different jump in normal for the situation So another way to get a plus 56 knockdown is off of back medium punch target combo Drive rush light kick light knuckle That's also plus 56 So you do the exact same setup On top of the plus 56 you can also set up a plus 60 like this Same as the last one just back medium punch instead of light kick Plus 60 And if you get this one uh this one's actually a side switch but you get a whole dash to do a frame kill So dash and then jump So it even looks tricky Safe jump right there A lot of people get hit by that straight up But what they can do is recover in place And now the dash jump doesn't work And even the trick from before where we changed to light kick in the air doesn't work anymore So that one's actually a harder read You have to say if they're going to get up in place you have to neutral jump here You get the same safe jump It's just a 50/50 which way they're going to roll A pretty stable side switch setup that doesn't use safe jump is just going to be forward dash three times I was off by a frame but you can see plus five there Try one more time There it is So buffering perfectly into itself You're left at plus six point blank which gives you a meaty standing medium punch with one extra frame on hidden block or you can set up a trade with your 10 frame things like that It's also worth learning the deeper options off of safe jump So so far this jump in normal that we've been doing of course hits high but a jump in normal with that timing is the only thing that's going to beat reversals on wake up So these next two options are kind of for when you've established that this is the option you're going for and you expect your opponent to respect that and block high So if we're expecting our opponent to block high on wake up of course we want to jump to make them think we're going high and then we can actually do an empty jump low off of the same setup The downside here as you can see on the frame meter is that there's about a five to six frame gap on wake up that they can mash through but you're kind of making the read that they're going to be blocking high here So you want to jump and then on the frame that you land or slightly before you want to input that crouch light kick as soon as possible And then we can go into a combo from there Arrow So now that we're representing a high and low option something they might try to do to deal with it is parry And they might get the perfect parry there as well Now while the perfect parry isn't going to punish you uh they are still going to avoid the mixup So one thing that we can do to deal with this option is empty jump into throw And this actually has a similar gap because the crouch light kick is five frames and the throw is five frames So there's going to be a window on their wake up where they can just mash out of both of these options So once you unlock this level now you just go back to the layer one and this is going to hit them meaty counter hit against their mash That's pretty much it for safe jumps So now let's look at a few non-safe jump mixups that you get off of these knockdowns So I'm going to do plus 56 like this one for example And then we actually get a true three-way mix with charged heavy hooligan So I'm going to do instant charged hooligan overhead You can see there's only a one frame gap on their wake up before they have to be dealing with this either blocking it high or doing a reversal And another option that we have here you have to manually delay this but you actually get a hooligan grab You can see I was off by one frame there There we go That was a meaty grab So if they're standing up that's going to snatch them And in order to deal with the DP you can also represent a bait off of this by just canceling the charge tool again immediately You can see this is only minus one you're left point blank which is in throw and jab range But if you have a feeling that they're getting a little too DP happy you can bait it out like this Another option for a meaty strike off of this is you can do charged heavy hooligan into the immediate kick followup for the dive kick You can see it's plus eight on hit giving us plenty of time to go into a heavy punch And on block this is also going to be uh quite meaty which gives us some nice frame advantage This is plus4 and you're in throw range and you're in strike range So you can do a lot with that The only downside is that this dive kick it actually just hits mid So they can block this high or low unlike the charged overhead Off of the plus 60 knockdowns you can actually get access to basically the same setup It's just that the first hit of this overhead is going to hit meteor And if you're going for the hooligan grab you're going to have to delay it manually by an additional four frames or so to make sure that it doesn't whip before they get up And same thing if I do the charge dive kick instantly this drops and leaves me punishable So you have to manually delay that timing just a bit Another option that you have off of these knockdowns is to go for hooligan dive kick and have it whip So plus 56 for example I'm going to do light hooligan into dive kick This leaves me at plus two point blank So you can get a true throw or low mix right there And if you do the same thing but with medium punch wool again you can see this leaves you plus four in throw range And similarly if you do the heavy one and with dive kick it's plus six And now you're out of throw range So you can put yourself at a variety of advantageous situations depending on the option that you want to do next And the only thing to look out for here is if they recover in place this will side switch but you're left at essentially the same range So this actually covers both sides Just be wary that you might cross yourself up into the corner And for plus 60 this actually works basically the same It just changes the advantage that you're going to have on wake up So there I did light hooligan after a plus 60 into whiff dive kick Leaves me at plus six Let's do medium punch hooligan off of a plus 60 This is plus eight And final one plus 60 into heavy hooligan 10 So actually off of this last one it's meaty enough that you can get a whole crouch heavy punch And this is plus two on block and that's going to be plus eight on hit giving you another route into heavy punch I could go on longer but for now I want to keep this video pretty short So if you guys have any comments questions anything about season 3 any thoughts about Cammy please let me know down below
