hey what's going on everyone it's Jack or Jessica here I know you all want this from me and I am here to deliver this is the jury guide you guys always wanted the basics the overview of the character all that stuff supers Etc so with that being said if you like this content let me know this does take quite a bit of time to make I would greatly appreciate you guys just taking time out of your day to like comment subscribe but for now you know let's get into this so jury's play style she is a very mixed bag but mainly very solid and really a jack of all trades kind of character Fireball DP good pokes fast buttons good movement all that stuff he's very versatile on what she could do and she can really mess with any form of a game playing you want to do you want a Zone you can do that if you want to rush down you know what I'm saying you can just play neutral play the footsies range she's very good at almost any sense of wherever on the screen Jimmy suffer quote unquote only because of her store mechanic but I do believe she has so many ways to store that it's not really a problem I mean you can throw it out establish a fireball game or you can do a combo get a store own block on hit it doesn't really matter so I think her weaknesses aren't really that potent per se but you know they can't be there they definitely can if you miss time a store so just be mindful of that but other than that I don't really see many weaknesses hurry so now let's talk about you know the good old classic all the buttons she has so the first start off overall I don't think your he has a bad button and I think everybody has its place and can be used in effectively depending on where you're at so let's start with the very simple one fan jab or 5lp you know it's your four frames you can change uh can change ABS into it you can combo different things into drive Ultra with it they can do different things it's a simple yet effective button especially cancelable so you know you could do something like that then you have crutch jab it's four frames as well I believe it is slightly further then stay in jail sometimes I have hit people close or further from me so it is a button definitely that I've used a good amount of times like before I can chain together it's actually cancelable nothing crazy all right so Stan like it so this button is five frame startup the quite good ending poke especially when you're about to take down an opponent for the game or for the round it is quite effective in that and also it does combo into certain buttons such as stamian punch into sound like it works the cool thing about this button is that weirdly enough it is quite far sometimes it can come to heavy DP from very far range you'd be surprised how far you can go so this button is definitely a very solid poke alright so crouching light kick or two okay five frame startup pretty solid poke pouch uh light kick into Crouch jab into store as a safe shrink and the one thing I I like to do especially with jewelry is when I'm Drive rushing in neutral because you are plus seven on hit the combo on Tuesday main punch which establishes a good 50 50 when you're trying to apply pressure but it is a very good poke yeah nothing crazy about it now this buttons staying medium punch this button is six frame startup Plus on block which is very good for this game most of the time if you ever see a character in this game they may have one plus unblock button and most times it's plus one however jury's of such case where it is plus two meaning she can frame strap with her light so she can do Stan jab afterwards to counter poke someone if they try to press a button if they believe that she will go for a heavier button or not really a friendship I might go for a walk up throw whatever this button is really going to be kind of a combo starter on head you are plus seven meaning you can do stuff like damn mini punch Crouch being a punch BP Damian punch try medium punch it's a store especially Drive Rush it becomes plus 11. but with this button being Drive rush you can do stamina punch stand heavy punch and from there you can do almost anything you should it's definitely one of those buttons where it's going to be used a lot in blockchains offense you can also definitely if someone tries to let's say unblock let's say they try to drive impact so I have enough time to react and do another samian punch but also since it's special cancel I can cancel it into drive impact so it's definitely one of those safe buttons especially if someone's trying to jump or they're trying to drive rush in you can always check them with this because it does move her forward so the very good button for like a lot of things especially offense very good very good you definitely want to try this if you are trying to figure out jury this is definitely a button you will definitely will be using now Crouch mean a punch very good poke Six Ring starter nothing uh too crazy right there however it does go diagonal and sometimes this actually can be jump ins it definitely is varied it's not your quote unquote anterior but it is a way to counter certain things in the air it is reminiscent of Street Fighter 4 jury so if you want to you know try and use that by all means it is also special cancel though so you can do something like this this is typically what people tend to do so if they do stamian punch crouching punch they may end it with heavy floor or DP like I shown before store you can end this with all sorts of things so it's one of those buttons where it definitely you can use to any combos with it is definitely a solid poke when it's dry brush it is plus nine so so it's definitely a button you will use for sure a good amount jury's Ford minion punch this button right here is a quite good it's A-frame startup and it's good for caramel extensions it is a nice poke and you can definitely make it safer store it is negative three it is safe on block however you definitely can get a store safely with this button so it's definitely something mostly players may do they may do something like this and they are safe on block even though you are negative four essentially is punchable but still at that range you are safe so definitely one of those folks you one of those pokes you can use to either just poke out neutral see what they do you can try and hick from it you can drive Rush with it you can do a lot of stuff with it so it definitely is a good button to use for sure all right now this fan infamously good button jury stand meaning kick um this is literally just Street Fighter 5 medium cake and nutshell but also even better I don't know you know how they put made it better but they did um so this button is five frames just like shoot our five uh it's quite good you know good poke pushy goes forward and it the first hit special cancels so this button has two hits and the way that this works is that the first hit you have a good amount of time two special cancel it so if you are looking to special cancel this button or buffer it you can also just try and drive much with it if opponent tries to counterpoke and you may hit them because technically her her box kind of reels back a bit so it definitely is a good poke to use um it's safe on block uh and when you drive drivers into it unblock you are zero but on hit you are plus seven so you can definitely experiment with certain different buttons depending on the frame uh Frame data so it is definitely a good poke overall and it's a good dry brush folks let's see if you're trying to establish offense in neutral you can sometimes do this and if an opponent sees the button some most of the time they tend to get beaten by this button because it hits them first or the first it hits and it counter pokes him so then you get some maybe like this so it is a very good poke overall it's very solid very uh strong it really doesn't have crazy downsides but it's overall very good all right jury's catching medium kick this button is A-frame startup by far very good special cantable the solid offensive starter especially if the opponent's walking back or maybe they're not believing that uh you can hit confirm it you can just use all uh on offense if they're trying to block it you can get a store safely from it as well and this button definitely is useful for clipping people on their feet get a surprise attack on it's definitely a very good buddy do many things uh afterwards such as DP store a heavy full uh you do all sorts of things you could do little four Fireball low Ford into ex firewall you can do so many things with this button and this button is a very very solid poke overall nothing too crazy it's a typical little Ford but it is a very good low forward all right jury's forward medium kick or as everyone calls it the overhead pretty normal overhead nothing crazy the only things about it that are actually kind of Juicy is on hit after drivers are on block so typically with overheads and older games they always used to be very punchful and black kind of like ground closers or uh you're about to get this done you have to do overhead power and this game it's a bit different basically in this game all the overheads are safe on block they're not really punishable or anything you can't really run you can take your turn afterwards but they're not really used to close out or like gets posts done and be very risky so this game definitely changed it up on the overhead game and then with also dry Rush added to it with these now they become Plus on block so since jury's overhead is negative three and drivers adds plus four frame advantage to your uh button this now becomes plus one meaning my Jabs will beat out anyone's jab because they try to press so that's something to take a note of in this game this applies to I believe every character has an overhead but if they drive Rush overhead they tend to be plus and you can set up many different sequences such as throws me uh meeties you can do all sorts of things so for example if Jamie decides not to block the overhead I can get a full combo it was definitely establishing in neutral or off of a Oaky situation uh 50 50 kind of so you definitely can get your offense started with this you can go low than high then high and low or something like that keep in mind of that when you are trying to salvage offensive jury that there's many different ways to approach all right jury stand heavy punch this button is kind of slow at 10 frame startup but it's a very far poke as you can see I'm hitting Jaime from a good range it is special accountable and this is kind of one of your combo starters because mainly this goes into medium for this goes into heavy for and you get many good different extensions on this you can go to 1000 to heavy store into DP you can do so many different things with this button so it is one of those buttons that for sure you will use a good amount especially when you're trying to poke maybe buffer with Drive Rush however even fleas now this button definitely can anterior however it is a bit slow at times because it definitely can get smoked so as you can see I try to do it on Jamie but he beat me however I do it early I can beat him but even then sometimes it's not crazy reliable jury's crutch heavy punch this is a frame startup pretty solid anterior as you can see if I do shaming do this he cannot jump in on me it was definitely a very solid anterior definitely does of course lose the cross-ups so if the fun does try and Crush you up at a weird angle or it's a natural cross-up it may get you uh beat unfortunately um this combo is the main thing just like stand heavy punch such as medium flaw DP do so many different things about this again um but yeah this button is pretty solid it's definitely a button a reminiscent of four and five of course with the difference from five to here this button actually moves you slightly forward in this game compared to five where it kind of hedgery stands still but other than that overall this button is very good for dry flush combos good for uh anti-air is just good for combo exceptions all that stuff so it's an overall click button Ford heavy punch this button is quite slow 15 frame startup it is punishable on block so in order to actually even trying to use this button if they're blocking a lot you have to store or we have to do something maybe to establish pressure or you know try and get something so that way you don't get punished because you are negative four so you can't get jackpot other than that this button is special candle you can it's a great combo starter because after this you can do almost anything you please so it is overall good to you know kind of poke out because the opponent starts rambling Drive impacting or doing something you definitely can use this to poke and keep in mind it is two buttons so sometimes one button one part of the buttons can whiff and the other one can hit but overall this button is not too bad to use for poking just keep in mind it is slow though you don't want to use it necessarily too much over her other fast jury's heavy kick this button is 17 frame startup it is safe on block with this button being safe on block you can actually do Parry afterwards or you can wake up DHCP so you can definitely mix up your options on your opponent if you choose to just of course there's always a risk to uh everything so of course if you do roundhouse and they call out Perry they can throw you and get you a punish counter call it exeb they can definitely punch you super hard so keep in mind of that with heavy kick on punished counter they actually jump so with this being said you could definitely do something like uh heavy DP established maybe an Okie game you could do level one super so you can do us all sorts of things like with this heavy kit but overall it's a very solid poke it is a very annoying poke considering jury moves quite far for it and also on Drive Rush this comes plus six on hit mini you can do something like this but it is overall a very solid button to use for poking scratch heavy kick or sweep as everyone let's call it 10 frame startup good to punish things move you forward you don't want to do this too much on block or to spam it's a very simple sweep nothing too crazy not really much to talk about other than that it's a sweep but yeah she moves forward which is pretty nice it's back heavy kick this button is definitely uh back from five ten frame startup it is special canceled to make safe I think definitely do something like that you can use it to throw bait people especially on wake up someone believes that you're gonna throw with them a lot you can also do back Kevin K to make them sit down it's definitely a button you can use to call out no jumping too much or something like that and you can also use it to probably check Drive impacts as well so overall none uh nothing too crazy very simple but jury's light jab is fireframe startup um this button I'm not really sure what to use for other than if people try to cross you up you just jump back Jab or if to end the game if they're jumping a lot again do the same thing like just beat them in the air but other than that I don't have much to say about this button now jury's jump medium punch is definitely a button people use a lot it is seven frame startup and it's good to use with a dive kick so it's definitely something that people mess with a lot especially you know waking up with the the opponent tries to throw them or just use it for cool combo extensions especially in the air so you definitely can do some cool stuff with this such as this type of combo but it definitely is useful for that and then also just of course Cornell jump uh jump outs juries jump heavy Punch or as I'd say jump on head is 12 frame startup it's definitely good for early jump ins because it hard knocks down so you get a midi setup afterwards and also the weird thing about this button is that it actually can cross off at times but that didn't cross up but that did so it definitely varies on the angle where it's at can cross up I mean as a dreary player I'll say we take those but you know it's definitely a weird button to think about all right so juries jump like kick it's a four frame startup it can cross up uh combos into lights good for starting pressure pressure nothing too crazy juries jump medium kick it's six rings uh startup it's very common cross up to be used you probably will use this a lot but it's definitely a button that you can use try and establish pressure with them especially with jumping so you can approach them a different way so jury's neutral and forward heavy kick she has two of these this is her neutral jump version and this is her heavy cake Ford have uh jump they're both 10 Franc startups are both the same and they both come out to Heavies so they both combo uh kind of withstand heavy punch crotch heavy punch stuff like that with neutral jump heavy kick however this because she splits her legs she actually hits both sides so if someone was to bypass you she actually would hit them on either side the neutral one neutral jump one is definitely used for optimal combos because you definitely if you hit it like you can get Ford heavy punch which is the most damaging thing you can do as a combo while Ford heavy kick is definitely the very most common one because you want to go forward hit the person get the heavy uh damage going all that stuff so that's the one you go use a lot but neutral jump is definitely useful it has its own uses though we're trying to call it like a headbutt or something like that from Hyundai it's definitely useful for that alright so during where's the target combo it's so good this one is not really used very commonly so this is stamian punch it back heavy punch and then heavy punch again so this chart combo is not crazy useful on hit I mean you definitely keep them away it's decent damage but you can definitely do something better off a stand medium punch the real interesting thing is on block about this button the first two hits are actually safe on block while the whole string is actually very negative it's negative 16. so you don't want to use the whole thing so the trick with this target combo is that you can actually just do the first two hits and because you're safe and you're at a good range you can actually sometimes counterparts people trust like punch starting can beat me right if I wait a Split Second I can actually drive uh driver rush and then punish counter so this target combo is definitely interesting I really haven't found a use for it especially in longer combos or something like that I've only found it useful if maybe I'm trying to get your my opponent's Drive gauge down because it does take weight roughly half a bar the first two hits so you're definitely gonna like do something like that um but other than that I haven't really found a use for it I'm pretty sure it's probably people who can find these for this but in my personal opinion I've not used for it so if you do let me know but I only use it for a little bit of counter poke type thing so uh yeah if you find use of four by all means all right so Drew throws you know the very simple throws nothing too crazy this one pushes them full screen in neutral and then background kind of roughly around the same time thing the trick with uh these throws specifically four throw actually is that you can Dash up and you can throw a Luke comb a lot of characters in this game have throw loops and jury is one of them so you can definitely establish some pressure with this or you can actually just do something like Fireball and just go from there though you definitely can mix up what you want on offense from this and in neutral typically the thing I tend to do is either I throw a fireball or I store or I can drive Rush uh into them and just get something else going but you definitely can do whatever you please uh stores I like they're called Full Hawkins but I prefer to call them stores with these they enhance your fullest I like talking fluas but they're also they have their own names but these basically enhance all these normal so you see these these are just regular typical vegetables but if you have a store it actually enhances them to be either a fireball a combo more combo extension or a good combo and or extra damage the stores this one the light version I'm doing uh can be up to negative four but it definitely can be safe on block if you add a button to it because some people's buttons do not reach that far so you can make it safe and it's very reliable to do that um it causes a knockdown on hit so you can establish pressure on them so do whatever you pleased with that but it combos into lights and mediums and it's overall the One You're Gonna use if you plan on storing in neutral as well so keep in mind of that Medium version as you can see it slightly moves are forward and it hits at a longer range if you need it for example that hits versus light not hitting but the only downside about this is that it is more negative on block so it is negative six however you definitely can make it safe but just keep in mind that because you go forward you'll probably be closer to your opponent and they may be able to punch you depending on the ring heavy store this one she takes a good step forward and you can tell because 25 frames startup is quite slow and this on block is quite punishable it is negative eight to negative nine roughly on block but the trick with this one is that actually you can do juggles for example you can do something like this or you can level one super You Can level three super You Can level two super you would definitely do many things and overall it's kind of like that you don't use this really a neutral like that it's not really meant to use neutral because uh if you mess up trying to clash with a fireball or something because these actually can Clash of fireballs you will take a step forward and you may get hit before this actually comes out so bear in mind with that now the EX version of this actually does the same thing as heavy it is a little bit faster at 16 frame startup so it's one of those things you can jungle people especially if you're trying to do medium medium combos so you can do something like that it's definitely nothing too crazy other Nina juggle to probably maybe finish a combo or something like that but you could do something like this maybe to close out around if you need to use level one also here's a fun fact about the stores actually is that you can indefinitely store in this game so the three is the most maximum she can have but actually she can store she used a store move but you won't gain any more enhancements but you can use this to deny Fireballs you can use this to just try and stop people from pressuring Maybe it's up to you but yeah this you can actually definitely store all right so the jury's fool us I like to call these foolas however they have their own name which I will tell you but to keep it simple I call them for us because that is the very simplistic name that people tend to call them so say hi show the light version if it's not installed very very low area covered tangly it clashes with projectiles but it's very bad on block and on hit with being a negative on hit and very negative on block however with this being enhanced it turns to a legit firewall basically with this with enhance this firework trial was quite far this is very good for establishing uh space it travels slow so you can definitely catch your opponent maybe if you want to dash forward but with a fireball or sometimes you don't even have to go with the fire but you can just store it back up and do it all over again and then also with the trick is that you can actually drive Rush afterwards on it and people now believe or now people see that you have a wall kind of or like a defensive Shield behind you so in case they do try and press a button the fireball will hit them and you can uh actually poke them after they hit you potentially but this is definitely a firewall you can mess with especially setups and maybe situations where you want to make a super super plus maybe establish you know something like this and over at uh firewall setup so you can do something like that um ex Fireball is two hits as you can see and it causes a knockdown so if I have them nope not blocked how's the knockdown you can use it for Oaky situations it goes quite full screen I believe it actually does go quite full screen uh all the way full screen so it is quite far too actions it at so it's up to you however you uh you want to use it you can definitely use it as a screw neutral move or maybe you want to establish pressure by doing this you can actually combo off of this uh I believe in the corner with DP but you can do stuff like this however you don't have much time to recognize it so unless you see maybe a button hit into it you may not be ready as much but it is a good ex move overall all right now for I can talk to is like to call medium Fuller when it's not uh enhanced or not installed it is very basic nothing too crazy you're safe on hit or you're plus three so you get pressure afterwards but you don't get any combos because the Fest Buttons game is four frames however when she has her stores then that's actually when it gets interesting the enhanced version on hit becomes plus eight so it's definitely a big jump from uh nine hands so basically with this but with this special move you can actually do any almost any medium if you do for me punch get the store back do a little forward and get the strawberry or more damage you can do so many things with this specific uh combo extension it was definitely useful for that on block this is not ideal because it is negative 10 on black so it is double digit so someone can uh punish you very hard for doing this but you definitely don't want to use this unless you're covering from a button for example if I do forward heavy punch into it something like that will work typically with this uh special movie you want to use it uh right after a heavy button because those are what it can come on too but it's not good for poking outering um ex is kind of the same thing only you have more frame advantage on hit because you are plus nine you can actually do something like this maybe if uh you don't have enhancements or stores stocked up they could do something like that um this does not use a stock uh fun fact all the EX moves of foods do not use stocks at all so if you want to if you don't have stocks for example establish pressure you can do something like this and then I get you started go do some damage and you actually get it stored right afterwards now go whole satsu or heavy for the regular version nothing too crazy decent combo Ender you get Oaky afterwards however it is very unsafe on block so it is negative 11 again double digits so but then the hands version actually does more damage it gives you Okie uh nothing too crazy um but it is unsafe on block so keep in mind of that sometimes juggle actually depending on what you do so for example if that if I actually feng shui which we're going to wait later and I do this uh combo I can actually Jug on the exec but depending on the height it actually can change up where you're uh Landing or how the opponents juggled so keep in mind of that but overall this is very good for combo Enders um for ex it's a good combo Ender to close out rounds maybe or to close out a game because this is actually a tip for uh all you guys who uh run on a jury any food I can cancel another four so the way that the chains work or like the cancels work is that if you press one of the fullest if you do core Circle forward let's say heavy floor and it's enhanced keep in mind these had to be enhanced in order to work but if you want to go from heavy to medium you do quarters before heavy but then you just press medium kick right after it it ends as you can see by my inputs and I just get a medium so let's say I do stand heavy punch and I'll say I do this I do Fireball but I want to cancel to uh heavy oh I did course before light kick and I press heavy to do that and I got Okie or if you want to do something very very cool you understand heavy punch medium uh light into me you could do something like that and you actually get plus eight and you can actually continue combos so that's something that three players tend to use a lot so you definitely want to use that to your advantage especially you plan on chaining them to do the very crazy Twitter combos um but yeah that's a little useful tip also here's another usual tip just in case people are confused about which ones to activate different ex who was because depending on which two buttons you press you actually get different versions so for example if you want ex Fireball it's core Circle forward light and medium kicks if you want ex medium Fuller it's light and heavy kicks and they're going ex heavy it's medium and heavy kicks and also you can chain the ex ones just like the regular one so you can do just like that all right so let's talk about Julie's 107 or as everyone calls it uh DP so let's talk about light DP fight DP is nothing too crazy um it's a good knock down Ender they get Oaky after it uh it is quite negative on block which I believe is double digit or actually sorry it's negative eight unblocked so it's nothing too crazy I mean you can do cool combos such as you know heavy store light BP and you get it's not your ideal combo Ender per se but it's something like decent so you can use this at the starting but there's definitely more optimal ways to use you can also actually cancel the super however into level three but it is a little bit hard sometimes even I'm struggling with it so keep in mind if you don't get it it's okay no no not everyone can get it so it's pretty fun now medium DP is definitely your go-to anti-air so for example if I still have Jamie jump I just beat him right away this is definitely your ideal answer of what you want to do she does not move very far from where she's at and that's a good thing because if a person has a weird angle of a jump in you can actually just do this and it'll hit a good amount of times it's a simple tool to use yet really hard to master because most people don't really uh learn how to anti-air so this is something you want to learn as as a player in general how to enter your DP so this stops people from crazy jumping in trying to test you with the jump ins and you know they're conditioned to not jump at you no more this is a tool you want to learn as far as far as heavy DP heavy DP is more so for far-reaching jump ins so if I have Jamie a jump heavy DB which reaches quite far and it's a really good anterior and you get not bad Okie but the same points as medium you want to learn it and you want to master it all the good stuff um EXP erimental wake up move uh just like uh from True R5 and four um if your opponent is trying to pressure you you just can wake up with this nothing too crazy um yeah other than that you can use it to close out maybe uh rounder games does decent damage so you do stuff like that alright so jury's dive kick I probably butcher in this but please forgive me this is good for air juggles this is good for going around Fireballs it definitely is pretty solid however the trick with this uh especially when it was that it can be very unsafe on block or it can be simply uh safe but the trick with this session was that depending on where it hits on the body varies How uh how safer on save it is for example if I try and Jamie from top of my top of his head I'm negative nine so I try to lower I'm safe on block potentially most of the time you are within uh you know from negative three to negative nine and it can vary um you don't want to use it too much because you definitely will get punish counter because after special moves you are in punished counter state so you definitely don't use it however the cool things with this dive kick is with you know stamp jump mini punch because you can do something like this and you can combo or if you just want to do it to go around firewalls and you hit them you can drive rush and then get Oaky off of it oh you can do stuff like that um ex is a bit different because if you use all the hits uh it juggles them even further but if you use only one hit you can actually get deep deep so it varies depend on which version you want if you want all the kicks one or you just want the trade tray head it all depends but with the all strings version where it juggles them you can actually get cool juggles such as DP you can actually get heavy floor you can actually get stuff like that and actually the more that the lower your delay it you actually can get cool even cooler doubles you can actually get some driver sequences going you can actually do a lot of stuff for example because I hit them kind of high and I delayed it you actually get cool combos like that so it varies depending on the angle and everything but it is more so a surprise move I tend to not use it crazy amount but I try to use it as a way to show people that I can have different jumping angles all right so let's talk jury supers first off is her level one super I'm not gonna pronounce her name because I don't know how to but it is a projectile super it works well with juggles such as heavy store and other ones and also you can do some cool stuff with it they can do something like this oh it's done too crazy it pushed them full screen so keep in mind of that so you are able to get a free store if needed it takes away one half of the drive bar so if you want to maybe just close to burnout someone or maybe uh you want the their Drive gauge to complete saw you lower than yours or something like that it's up to you and a fun little tip is that if you have a store actually with it and you hold a kick button any kick button while the super is happening it will consume a stored but do extra damage so that's the trick with storing afterwards especially with heavy stores that if you choose to get a store but then you do level one and if you want to burn the store for extra damage for the level one by all means now feng shui is a very special super because it is an enhanced or I install super sorry and it actually is very interesting to use because this one is very Freedom based so what this super is actually does that it chains any normal into each other so I can do uh stand medium punch light kick into the same medium uh kick and all this if I can do something like that and it's not that's not supposed to be really a combo in this game however she's able to do stuff like this the only problem or not to say problem I guess the only counter to this was that it's very scaled depending on what you start with so for example if you start with lights for every hit it's going to scale lower lower by 10 so you tend to not want to do light light medium medium heavy heavy kind of like thing because they'll do a very low damage however if you do medium medium into heavy it actually does a good amount so that's one thing you want to keep in mind when doing this also another thing about this that this makes any special move now cancelable then I'll Crouch like a special candleball you know any other normal that wasn't special cancel is not social cancel um this also has different properties for different moves depending on when you use this for example if I do a medium medium correct medium punch to medium kick into crotch fears CrossFit is now a launcher so now you can do something cool in the air with it and you can actually jump with it punch into dive kick however you please or you can like do jumping punch heavy kick and dive get the Oaky situation so this is definitely a freedom based super so you can do so many things with this changes heavy kick as well epic launches so it's definitely something to take consideration because this changes a good amount of jury's normals what from what you think of so this super is definitely super Freedom based there's so many cool combos on Twitter and on YouTube and everything about this uh super it is very uh it is kind of annoying to euthanize only because it is a level two so just keep in mind you won't have a level three or you may not have a level one depending on your meter usage but it definitely has its uses especially trying to chip out for Drive sequences or maybe they're in Burnout and remember with burnout uh you had plus four advantage to every normal or anything you have so you can actually use that to your advantage especially because these buttons go from being negative on block to being potentially plus unblocked so you can do stuff like that and also fun fact if you do the super and you hold a punch button you can actually do a little Dash It's a reminiscent of the sure5v skill and you get a combo started from this actually for example I can do something like this you do something like that so this is a very Freedom based super use it how you see fit and now finally her final super uh her level three her level three is quite useful it is 10 frame startup and it's fully invincible and it goes decently far nothing too crazy um this is useful especially if you're in a situation where maybe you're low on Drive gauge and you need to recover from it or if you want to put the opponent in Burnout because it takes away two bars of the drive gauge so keep in mind of that um it can come with certain special moves such as this you can do something like light EP as I showed before it's definitely used a lot um sometimes like an anti-air uh it can do so many different things so it's up to you to use what you feel is personally best you mean I see many level twos from me but don't don't discourage you don't make me discourage you from you as you can see overall jury is quite a versatile character who can perform many Combos and Savage space for herself she can especially cancel many buttons and be created on her approaches she can Zone you out she can pressure she can play neutral she can do so many different things um some little tips like to play jury that you want to try getting space and use stores and combos or black strings to establish pressure but also use their pokes to convert they can do stuff uh that's pretty cool overall um but yeah she is very very very versatile you can do so many things with this character it's actually kind of crazy um this is definitely something that you definitely want in a character if you want a Jaguar trades character who um can almost do anything and to a point where I could say she almost has almost nothing wrong with her then this may be a character for you she is quite good in this game currently right now as I'm making this video and overall I would say try and give it a shot if you enjoy the way she plays and everything um this definitely took a lot of time because it definitely took a good script and trying to understand this and shout outs to my editor for doing all this this is definitely something that I know you guys wanted to do and I was like you know what I'll try to look for the people but yeah make sure to subscribe for sure uh to show the support but like comment subscribe let me know what you guys want the next video and I should see you next time [Music]
