[Music] Terry at first glance might seem like a straightforward character throw a Power Wave to force them to approach if they jump antire with Rising tackle if they walk forward check them with medium burn knuckle which can also be plus a block if you space it properly or use your Crouch medium kick which hits low and has great range both of these allow you to start your offense and if you guess correctly you can make them explode with Terry's great combo game but to master Terry you need to learn some of his more complicated combo routes and learn how to use all his moves to form a proper game plan also as of this recording I'm in the top top 10 terries in North America so you know you're going to dance time stamps below let's get started a story of Terry's normals uh you got stand light punch crash light punch stand light kick crash light kick uh his lights are pretty standard uh Crouch light has a little bit more hit stun than his stand light punch so for example something like this is a very basic combo you can do with Terry however if you use St light punch it actually doesn't combo and you'll be punished right so the main benefit of stand light punch actually has more range than Crouch light punch so for example there's certain combos where you have to end in St light punch just so you get that extra range and that will combo into DP does really good damage but in terms of mashing usually because it's crouching I'll just Mash Crouch light punch so Crouch light kick is is just your standard low confirm um so for example like if you're trying to mix up people with overheads you you might want to throw in a Crouch light kick as well and like obviously this this right here will combo or after Drive rush you can do something something like this into into whatever right but yeah Drive Rush Crouch L kick into crou medum punch is is pretty good use of that as well other than that you're not really using this as much you don't want to like mash with this because like you're not going to get any any damage off this right um stand light kick this is like probably his best neutral button right that goes the furthest it's also really good for punishes so having a five frame punish that goes pretty far is actually really important this game and the other thing it's useful for is that at max range it combos into this tackle and the tackle is plus4 which means that you get like an additional combo after it if you're like at the right spacing and there's like certain spacing traps we can talk about that utilize this but the most common situation is like after like a drive Rush light normal crou medum punch stand lay kick and then tackle that'll be plus four all right so let's talk about mediums this Crouch medium punch this is like your typical like I need to check Drive rush or with punish something it's really fast you can drive Rush cancel it get a bunch of damage on just regular hit goes in the medium knuckle or medium tackle medium knuckle does a little bit more damage but medium tackle can like give you a safe jump so it's kind of up to you what you want to use I just almost always go in the medium knuckle because is like the corner carries on it's really good the other thing I like crash me punch for is Whi punishing throw so I don't a lot of his like shimmy normals aren't the best crou me punch is actually really good on reaction and on punish counter it goes into heavy tackle so 3K off of a punish counter crash minum punch really really good also like it's really good for punishes right so like let's take for example like this right same idea 3K for punishing a Mya 6 move uh really good all right stand medium punch stand medium punch is interesting so it doesn't look like that gray of a normal it goes forward a little bit doesn't have that great of range compared to some of the stuff but the main advantage is it has multiple Target combos you can do the strongest one I think to just throw out is this medium punch heavy punch and if you're new to Terry I would be abusing the [ __ ] out of this because it's pretty much always safe unless you're really close so for example like I could it's my as five but I you see I my my five frame whips even if I'm like like I have to be like literally Point Blank and in that case don't do it there right it also naturally frame traps so if people are just mashing uh they'll just get counter hit so it's it's really good at like blowing up new players too but even at high level like if you just see people that like like to press buttons a lot on your block strings you can just kind of like walk up and and press this button with like not that much risk I also has a couple other Target combos that don't get used as much medium punch heavy kick heavy kick is a it's a good Target combo mainly for like juggles so for example after punish counter sand heavy kick you can you drive rush into this and uh that's pretty much optimal right there right I thing a lot of people know this actually has a just rame you can delay the third heavy kick so you see how it made that like little sound effect and did a little bit more damage that's the just frame version it's worth going for because like doesn't really hurt but it's really hard and don't expect to get it too often just be careful about throwing this out because it's doesn't actually combo on counter hit so it's really risky just to like kind of Swing because like even if you like see it hits you might uh get screwed over so he also has this like Lane change Target combo where you basically you medium punch medium kick into medium kick again to stay on the same side or for medium kick to guy go on the other side I'm going keep it a buck this thing is pretty bad uh at least currently because on on block you're just punishable you can't do the followup and on hit like like this this just does more damage right so it doesn't really have much use in my opinion I unless like you're trying to Corner swap so for example like after a punch counter di you can you can kind of you can you know kind of reset like that there's also what's what's the what's I think it's like right you can do something like that as well but most of the time like it's spending Drive I just go back throw and you get better Oki and they're actually in the corner and you don't spend drive so you're recovering drive all right medium kick it's it's like an okay poke like there are some better medium kicks like bison medium kick but the main advantage of this medium kick is that on counter hit you can actually link level one super and this thing does a crap ton of damage because the way it works is like normal into Super doesn't scale at all so this is just really really good damage it's actually like it's a pretty easy hit confirm and you just get 3K damage so like normally like I'll I'll fish for it like for example like like let's say I'm doing a block string and then like I'll wait a little bit and then see if I get the counter hit you just have to be a little careful because if this doesn't hit you know you can't the super won't combo you see there the the combo counter reset there but other than that like unless you're fishing for level one I wouldn't really recommend throwing this this button not more and that's because you have the god button which is Crash me kick this thing is absolutely insane in my opinion this is the best Crouch medum kick in the game and probably one of the reasons why you want to play Terry the reason it's good it's one of the longest range Crouch medum kicks and it's Drive rush cancelable or it's just special cancelable right which means you can do Drive rush into big damage off of a low which prevents people from just walking back on you which kind of ties into his whole game plan because if they can't walk back then it's really easy to space this the other thing that kind of puts it above all other crou Min kicks is this target combo so this target combo is extremely strong for a couple different reasons one is that instead of like just raw HIC confirming which like this is really hard right like I could do this um but like if it's blocked it's it's unsafe instead I can go for Target combo into H knuckle good damage good Corner carry and you don't have to spend any Drive which is a really important thing right and on Block it's still special canable so you can go for a mixup now there's one downside and that's if they have super if it's basically like impossible to bait it right you have to like Drive Rush cancel then do nothing and then Super back it's like kind of cringe that is a possibility but it's also like let's just put it this way I'm 1900 Mr and no one's done this to me once so please abuse this see this is very very good you can just kind of throw it out neutral especially when you have Drive meter and realistically when you're starting out with Terry this is going to be the main use of Drive meter either this or if they start to catch on to the Target combo you can just do Drive rush into a button and that way you're safe from like DPS and supers and that sort of thing the whole idea is that you don't have to spend drive if this hits right that's the main benefit to something like this like yes this does more damage but saving your drive so on the next dock down you can do something like this and then do the same do the same situation again is really really strong all right Heavies Crouch heavy punch this thing is an okay antire it trades a lot compared to like a lot of other oh yeah see it just loses compared to a lot of other normal anti this thing is kind of subar so I recommend not relying on this very much even when you're starting off with the character DP is uh way better antire right it's mainly for combos after Drive rush just Combos and the H tackle like this works as well which is really strong so this is like his best combo starter and then this works and you see that already did 3K and I did like a third of the combo think of this as Combos and really bad antire all right stand heavy punch this is uh it's also like I'd say like this is like kind of your second shimmy normal the main advantage of this is it's two hits so you can do a lot of cool things with it so for example like like let's say I set the dummy the random block right and I can't really hit confirm whether it hits or not like see I'm trying to drive Rush cancel I can't do it right but because stand heavy punch is two hits I can drive Rush cancel it on hit on hit what is that he got the idea or you can like H for with a burn knuckle actually I guess it's just medium right so you have a lot of different options to like kind of hit confirm this so it makes for a pretty decent like mey the first hit naturally combos in the H tackle which is like your big damage starter all right so crash heavy kick this is a sweep I'm going keep a buck this sweep is trash this might actually be one of the worst sweeps in the game game I almost never use it one it's generally slower than a lot of sleeps so one compared to Reus sweep it uh it's slower but it also has like pre oh my God that didn't even Whi pun yeah this thing's just bad so instead usually like after sweep I'll punish with like crash meme kick into uh Target combo into burn knuckle or if they're like really close right you can you know you can do something like this for Max damage it does have like obviously has some nich ues but like like this should be the last button you actually use with Terry all right so stand heavy kick this is a pretty decent button it's a little too slow to like whff punish a throw or like whiff punish some things but like if it's like something really laggy like let's take for example like this this stand heavy kick is probably like your go-to whiff punch right because this combo does like almost 3K and even if this thing is blocked I guess it's not the end of the world right it's only minus 4 which means that like at this push back it's safe so even a block it's a it's a pretty good situation so I think of this is like a long range whiff Punisher you can also like use it to kind of Auto shimmy like for example if they go for delay Tech on knockdown which is just a delay throw I can just use T heavy kick and like kind of automatically time it so it uh beats a throw you can also just kind of like throw it out there at this range but I feel like if you're going to throw out something it's it probably should be burn knuckle cuz this move is really good all right he has one uh command normal it's just this overhead forward heavy punch uh you're pretty much only using this like after a drive Rush uh it comos into the Crouch medium kick into bird knuckle so if you want a really easy Loop that will destroy new players you can just keep literally looping this over and over and if they're like below Platinum uh you just won the game if you just keep looping this overhead because that'll beat mashing it'll beat a lot of things and they have to block it overhead and even if they Block it's plus one block so that's the main way you're using the overhead you can also just throw it out it's like a it's a pretty decent like rounder all right so let's talk about jumpins uh jump jab is your fastest jumping so like sometimes I'll use this if I got like air to air something really quick I've never used jump leg kick in my life I don't know why you would why you would use this thing jump medium punch is is probably your best air to air because let's say they uh they get hit it has this like knockdown State compared to you know jump jab which just kind of air resets them so his jump medium punch kind of like floats them which means you can like get a DP after so it's really good for like characters that like the air stall you can get some pretty decent damage and you can like and go into level three and now they're dead right uh jump medium kick is really good as your cross up so if they're if you're ever behind the opponent you just do jump medium kick and you can get a pretty decent uh situation uh jump heavy punch it's okay I feel like jump heavy punch is mostly outclass by jump heavy kick uh this thing has a really good hit boox it's pretty disjointed and it's it's just like really active so I feel like I feel like jump heavy kick wins a bit more against like grounded an tire so I I like to do jump heavy kick all right let's talk about specials so let's start with a fireball so the fireball it's kind of weird you have three different versions The Light one's just kind of your standard Fireball it'll go under other Fireballs it's like both a blessing and a curse cuz like sometimes like if you do your Fireball first you'll win and you'll punish counter them which is really cool but if you do your Fireball later you'll get hit and they'll be able to block in time so just treat it like a normal Fireball but the earlier you do it against their Fireballs the better it's also pretty slow which means that you can kind of like Drive Rush In And right you can get like a pretty decent combo like this but realistically it's not going to hit that often you you mostly just like follow in and like go for like a throw mix-up or something all right so the medium power wave or Fireball whatever you want to call it it's interesting right so if they're up close it has the benefit of knocking them down on counter hit so if this hits right that's really nice so if you're using as like a counter poke you should probably use this version instead of this version because this won't knock down this knocks down and then you can like you know go for mix up and that sort of thing the second benefit this has is so like let's say I try to Parry the fireball I Parry the light I try to Parry the medium and you see how like I kind of flinch and the Parry Whi making their Parry Whi is good for a couple reasons one is like like it waste some of their drive and two if you read that they're going to Parry you can do this and then drive rush though and you see this is a punish counter which means it does a lot of damage it takes a lot of their um drive just a really good situation for you so because of that it'll make that opponent hases it to pair your normal Fireballs which means they do Drive damage and this heavy version it's mostly for combos or you can use it for pressure like for example I'll do stuff like this and then this say plus unblock which means you get a throw mix up be a little careful because this is like perfect Parry bait especially at high level people are really good at perfect parrying this I'm not the best but you get the idea oh yeah OD Fireball this thing is good it's really really good in Burnout because they're just forced to take chip damage I don't like to do it too much in neutral because like this is a lot of drive and even your mixup is like it's really hard to beat mashing like let's say they're just mashing uh like after they block this so like even if I do it like here like it's really hard to like get a run up walk up throw that beats jab so mostly where I like it is like when they're in Burnout because I can do this and then I could go into burnout loot pressure which is really strong this also combo so like you'll sometimes see it in combos as well all right bur knuckle now this move is probably the goat and Terry has the best Crouch medium kick in the game and I still think this move is better medium burn knuckle I'm skipping light bird knuckle because this move is just so good it does everything for you right it if you space it out it's Plus on block uh you can do jab after you get you get all that damage after this is this is really really really potent at this range and if you get them to sit still you can just go for a throw right this puts you in perfect throw range so after blocking burn knuckle you basically get a free mixup which is insanely good for a boo that literally goes half screen and even if you like missp it a little bit it's still safe this is safe it's still like they can't punish you for this right you can tell when you're plus when you get this little screen shake this move is just insanely good it's really good to throw out it's also really really quick so like people can't react to it right like I'm going to try a perfect pair of this I'm just getting hit every time yeah I I can't do it oh I can only do it like here at like the maximum spacing but like if I'm a little based like here I just whiff parry and then I die you might think di is a really good strategy yeah it's not even a good strategy cuz if you try di in reaction you'll just get hit again the only consistent strategy really is like you just got to outspace it right so it means like you got to like you got to walk back make it whiff you can neutral jump and punish it you can also like walk forward and like you know mess up their spacing that way there's there's definitely some things you can do but again if they're if you if the opponent's playing really passive and they're waiting for your burd knuckle that means you can just walk forward take up some space right so this this move just completely dominates the pacing in the matchup and some matchups all right so light bur knuckle this thing is okay you can use as a combo Ender I don't recommend it because this is just better because Corner carry and knock down it's also a decent mix-up tool this is kind of gimmicky like if you just like this is the second hit's an overhead but if the first hit hits it's a really really slow overhead but if the first hit whiffs the second hit is still an overhead and it's actually quite fast and I haven't met anyone that can block this on reaction yet so you can do this you don't get that much damage off of it 400 but like you can still like get a throw mixup it's good for like taking back your turn right cuz like let's say the opponent just likes the mash like you'll either trade or like let's say they do something slower you'll counter hit them so it's pretty good to like end your block strings with and it's pretty hard to punish it's only minus five so like they need to be really on point to be able to punish it because it looks like it should be a lot more punishable oh my I didn't even block it there yeah that what I can't even punish it from like max range but you get the idea if you want to be really cheesy this com is in this cancels in the level three it's such a good round Ender I actually uh I'm doing this against some like really high level opponents and it's working pretty consistently all right so anyways H bur knuckle this thing's uh pretty good as well the issue with this compared to the other bird knuckle is it's slower which means you can you'll might get perfect par more but it's also easier to make plus you can see all these spacings these are all plus even that's zero which means you can Mash he also has two OD versions of this the OD corle back light punch and medium punch I guess it's it's like okay for like a mixup yeah it's also pretty fast it also hits overhead still minus five and I guess the benefit is like it combos into level two I've never used this move once in my life it's also like decent for combos but again I don't think his optimal use this very often so again I don't really go into this much if I want to go into level two after this combo I have to do like that that ex move that's the only real use I know for it the other ex move this is also like a pry good punish counter starter it's cool because like let's say you block a DP you can like punish kind of this and you they get a wall bounce and I think you can do like like something like that but there's actually more optimal stuff like like this is actually more optimal it just does way more damage so I I don't know when you're actually supposed to use this either maybe it's like if you're close to the Cor corner there's probably like some optimal routing I forgot you can do stuff like that right that's pretty nice as well and also combos in the level two cuz this doesn't oh this does but it just does less damage and also the the medium heavy and the lay heavy versions are the same so it doesn't really matter which one you use oh yeah you can do this into that and then h ah sheesh all right Third special is his DP there three different versions uh they're all good for anti good for combos um generally you want to use the heavy version for most combos don't want to use light here cuz like sometimes they'll whiff 95% of the time if you're doing a combo and if you're starting out you use heavy DP light DP is really good because it recovers really really quick like this is probably one of the quickest recovering light DPS in the game so like let's say you accidentally wh your antire uh it's generally like a lot safer cuz like sometimes the opponent won't react or like you for whatever reason you miss your antire like you might be like safer in like scramble situations right the other two DPS are decent for antire um especially if you do them later the heavy DP does do the most damage but if you do them early for whatever reason like the heavy DP doesn't do that much and the medium does a little bit less but the light still does full damage right generally like I try to use light DP almost all the time for anti just because it's like it's a lot safer and it's pretty easy to autopilot but I think technically like heavy DP is more optimal in some situations when you can do it like really deep and ex is just your standard reversal throw it out on wake up 10 to 15% of the time and you'll be good mistake a lot of beginners make they try to use this as antiair generally you just you know use the meterless version Drive is really important crack shoot for special uh this is probably is worth special to be honest the heavy version is good for combos right you've seen this combo a million times the minium kick version pretty decent i' say I probably use the medium kick version the most it goes pretty far like it can go over Fireballs it can go over like low pokes it's kind of good just to like throw out in this range because you do get a knockdown and even on block like it's it's just safe right and if you space it out properly like you're not in throw range so the punishment for blocking it's not really that bad you can like throw it out after like some things on block and like this will so for example like people are mashing after your Crouch medum punch they'll frame trap them yeah and so like you can like kind of maintain your turn I don't recommend throwing out the heavy version much just cuz it's kind of slow it loses to di it loses to like perfect Parry but you can't throw it out like very rarely most of the time when I use a crack shoot It'll like whiff or like I'll just be in throw range and I'll be like damn I should have done meum bird knuckle realistically like most of the time you're doing crack [ __ ] you should be doing a medium bird knuckle it's also like a decent round din like I I'll sometimes like do crack [ __ ] on their wake up like let's say I need the like beta shimmy like I'll just do like Dash up or I need the beta th I'll just do Dash up crack shoot and like this will catch it'll punish caner but it also like covers a lot of other options like like let's say let's say I don't know they like jump or something it'll catch that as well yeah it's also like kind of anteris preemptively like you just throw it out and they happen to be jumping like you can get a hit and you actually get like a Juggle after it too which is kind of nice uh same thing with OD I honestly I never use this move there's there's some combos they use this I don't think any of them are good the main place I'll do this is when they're burned out right so crack Shoot actually kind of takes a life of its own if they're burned out you can just kind of keep doing this string over and over but you'll see like eventually they'll get pushed out see how that crou me punch whiffed so what you can do is you can cancel ex crack shoot which brings him closer and you can just kind of keep rotating this right and this makes a really really strong burnout Loop H talk about supers um level one it's your standard Invincible super very good on wake up especially if you're low driver or you have no drive I would spend level one instead of doing ODP so it's really good if you have a read that they're going to do a mey against you um cuz they'll beat that it's also a relatively fast super too so it's uh it's pretty good for like reacting [ __ ] like let's say you're trying to react to like a burn knuckle like you can just kind of do it it goes forward which is like really strong especially like compared to other suers you can just like buffer it and it's uh it's pretty good it does decent damage as well pretty much after any combo like you can you can sneak it into I only generally you're only trying to spend level one super if it's going to burn out or it's going to kill if it's if it's not going to burn out it's not going to kill don't spend super in your combos level two super uh the nice thing about this it's also a attack super it's on core ccle back so like it's if your rever burned out like it's you can just kind of buffer it and then if they do something it'll come out which is kind of nice um if you press punch two punches again you'll do the followup cost three drive and if you do another three punches you you spend another meter right so actually some of his optimal combos use this instead of level three cuz it'll do a little bit extra damage but realistically like between this and level three they're really similar in damage and sometimes like level three can do more damage Advanced Terry [ __ ] right the main benefit to this super is it's on core Circle back so it's easier to react to stuff it also can like go through Fireballs which is kind of cool level ones can't so like let's say I'm just like buffering and like okay I see that all right now you just took 4K damage for doing a fireball and also like it makes up for a pretty good antire too it is a little slow but like yeah you just took 4K for getting jumped on level three it's your standard level three the nice things about level three is that it restores your drive and drains the opponent's drive so like let's say I land something like this again level three is you can pretty much tack it onto any of your combos at the end uh now I'm at full drive and my opponent only has two bars of drive and then I do this stuff and let's say they block like they're going to be even less drive so I recommend usually for if you're a new player almost always spending level three when you have it but you know as you get more advanced like there's a lot of strategy that goes into when you use your level three Terry's no exception it's pretty much standard strategy let's talk about Terry combos so when you are new to the character you want to minimize the amount of combos you're learning thankfully you can get by with only a couple combos with this character uh the first is just combo into heavy shoulder so punish counter crash medium punch heavy shoulder stand heavy punch punish counter heavy shoulder then heavy punch one hit combos in the heavy shoulder so you see there's a lot of opportunities to like combo in the heavy shoulder and this H shoulder cancels an H knuckle you Double Dash and then you get a strike throw mixup that's really it and you can land this in a number of different ways so let's take for example the opponent does Di especially if you're new right same idea stand heavy punch one hit H tackle h knuckle Double Dash get a mix up right even if the opponent DPS you can do the same exact thing except you just let the St heavy punch it twice the cool thing about Terry is he has a lot more advanced combos right one of the iterations off this H shoulder is he can do this crack shoot and this heavy crack shoot and you have to delay it slightly to get these straight hits and this this combo actually does more damage now there's some debate on which combo you should do generally I go for the h knuckle because I value the corner carry and the better mixup so some of the things that make me go for the h burn knuckle is is if I'm low on Drive I don't want to go for this [Music] combo because I'll have to spend drive for a mixup right but if I ever want to go into Super I have to go do this route because I can't cancel the other route in the super now there's a couple other combos I think you should learn these how I say these light shoulder Loops are really important uh the most common way I get the light shoulder Crouch light Crouch medium punch standand light and then you can do whatever end you want that's the most common Ender is just going into the DP but you know you can do stuff like this and then do another light shoulder uh it's pretty good you get a restand or you can you know do the crotch light into medium bird knuckle they're all really good another really common way I'll get this if I'm doing like a delay like a Crouch jab at like this range it combos on counter hit the stand light kick and I can get the same followup right the other most common way I get this is like if I they ever block this like medium burn knuckle and then they m Ash after it sets up the perfect spacing for you to get that tackle as well and you can also Land The Tackle like if if you're like really cracked like you kind of like recognize specific distances that this will work like take for example like I ever land this I can still get the light tackle right at this range so instead of going the like medium burn knuckle here I can just go into light tackle and then tack on quite a bit extra damage right all right in the corner it's pretty much the same except when you do H tackle you can cancel it into H Fireball and then you can end in DP so driver combo the very easy combo to do is Crouch medum punch stand heavy punch and to tackle to you know your typical Ender that this works after almost every Drive Rush except jab and then jab you just do jab crash medum punch right and then you can kind of like do this and that's pretty much it for drive there are ways to optimize this right so for example if it's if it's like a Crouch medium punch you can go to stand medium kick that does a little bit extra a little bit extra damage it's a lot easier just to autopilot this because it does pretty similar damage all right so let's talk about strategy and I'm going to do strategy a little bit different anyone in chat that's like low masters high diamond want to play a quick two out of three give me your Mr is clearly someone that's Master but okay anyway so let's talk about the Terry match in real time so I I've never played this guy before I don't know who it is um I'm going to look for place the medium knuckle right and then I'm just going to go in now I could HC confirm that one I see I was looking oh I did not combo that optimally but you see like yeah just playing strike throw dash ward after throw is automatically times a throw Loop so I'm going to see if they know how to deal with it are they XDP oh that was a good punish they got those oh they went that version okay I'm going to look for crou me kick they're they're trying to play these like footsies oh I could have anti of DP but all right so he's playing a little bit aggressive yeah yeah overhead see if he knows how to deal with oh I just missed Ed it oh that was a good with punch all he burn himself out I get combo again we can do the rest we talked about I missed the delay oh and now he's like he's actually just screwed because that the was guaranteed and then I just go to level three he's dead and the reason that di was guaranteed uh if you do Drive Rush Crouch minium punch into Di and they don't have super and they're burned out you get a guaranteed stun there so this guy's pretty aggressive uh so it's really important for me to be like really on point with my antir and like maybe try to whiff punish like a burn knuckle unless he wants to like just walk in that was good oh no he doesn't know the combos so I'll just kind of like Gap him if I know like better combos than him right I'll try to go for a burn knuckle oh I missed the the overhead block that still is kind of tricky the is really good if they uh if they're burned out oh that's that was that actually really clean on his part Sam kick does combo into that all right I'm going to I'm keep up with the pressure all right see I'm abusing Target combo all right wait for the antire go for oh good back dash and then I can just keep doing the drive Rush combo if you ever want to extend a drive Rush combo you just do you can just literally keep looping it oh I missed the combo yeah see so like that's the bad side about bur knuckle is like he basically put himself in the corner by doing bur knuckle too close I'm going good for yep see he uh he crouched or he stood up and that's the power of like having one of the best Crouch Min kicks in the game right if if they ever stand up you just clip them low Drive rush and then you make going explode okay so if you made it this far in the video um you might be wondering you know how to improve a Terry I think you know watching the guy maybe rewatching it pick up some stuff you didn't pick up it's great idea but realistically if you want to get better you either have to head online and which I'm sure you guys are doing or you want to practice drills and some of the drills that I recommend practicing with Terry obviously very basic like a being able to anti very very important right because it makes this Fireball game just that much scarier right because like any time a fireball thrown and if they don't get a punish counter that means you could have uh anti right being able to antire at this like crossup range is also really important if you don't know this is called a cross cut you basically do like a half circle back and it'll auto correct your DP the other thing I practice if you're new to Terry is this Crouch medium kick kick airm right so so put the dummy on random block on block go into drive rush into throw or you can do Drive Rush Crouch medium punch and the throw on hit you just go into H knuckle so I definitely practice that you can also do random guard on counter hit and you know make sure you can pick airm this into level one super okay this one's a little bit trickier uh if you want to be really cracked because you're going to be doing a lot of Drive Rush crou medum punch so for example like after any cancel Drive Rush crash me punch is really good being able to hit confirm this is really important so so this drill is going to be Drive Rush Crouch medium punch and then on hit you always go into stand heavy punch right into the your B&B and on block you go into throw or you can just go into shimmy right you can like walk back see if they whiff a throw press crou meum punch so let's put this on random guard show you it's doable see H so pretty doable another thing if you're trying to get good of Terry because his Auto shimy game is not that great if the opponent does either Dr Drive Parry or withi throw we'll say they like delay a throw slightly and they rotate between these two I want to be able to punish either one so if they if they whiff a throw I want to be able to punish with this and if they Parry I want to be able to walk up Parry in time see all right so I I got to throw and then if you want to make it even harder you can have them jump forward out of the corner and this is like this is start of this is some of the stuff in order for me to improve my Terry this is the stuff I have to do just to show you give you example all right we got that okay well you get the idea that did punish I was trying to do a regular DP A little sloppy on my cross cut all right got the punish counter got the DP you get the idea yeah if you really want previe ter do drills like this it'll get you a lot further than just playing rank match anyways if this guy was helpful consider like share and subscribing really helps out the channel and helps me make more guides like this right if if people don't like if people don't sub off these guides I I'm going to be real I'll probably keep doing them because I like making guides it helps me helps the community I really like that but it'll encourage me to make work guides especially if this helped you and you know you can kind of pay forward anyways let me know down in the comments below if anything else I could have included uh obviously there's some additional combos additional uh Tech out there but you know I didn't want this guy to go for three hours anyways have a good day and peace
