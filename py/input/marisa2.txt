howdy howdy howdy back at it again today's video going to cover Mara combos you absolutely need to know if you're trying to pick up the character if you like this type of content if you want to see more of it leave a like on the video subscribe to the channel i'm trying to grow it heading into year three and I'd really appreciate the support without further ado let's get into the video so I want to start with what is the most common situation to land a combo where you have a guaranteed hit and that's off of a jump so you should always no matter how high they hit from have enough time to link into back heavy punch into heavy dema and then from there you have a couple different options so if you're backed up not near the corner at all charged heavy punch is what I'm going to end with most of the time it does good damage it has really good Okei right so I can convert mixup or whatever after I hit him with it and that's great if you're interested in that check out my season 3 knockdown zinoi video and I go over all of that stuff in depth otherwise drive rush back heavy punch into heavy superman or into medium quadriga both do very good corner carry both have pretty good oki if you just drive rush afterwards right and you like drive rush into throw or into button and you're in a really good spot if you land these midcreen that's even better oi and it sets up a safe jump or you can extend this for a little bit more bar with an OD superman punch and generally you're going to want to do uh dash into chargeback heavy punch into heavy gladius cuz that lets you combo into level three without spending a bunch more meter or you can do the brand new season 3 combo just for fun that showed off where you cancel this into a charged level one otherwise if you're a little bit closer the ender you should go for pretty much all of the time is this charged heavy punch heavy punch which sets up a safe jump and just does more damage than the dry rush back heavy punch into heavy superman so those are like the basic enders that you're going to want to think about anytime you end a heavy dema the next guaranteed combo situation that I want to look at is off of a punish counterd so you see them do a DI or they do a really unsafe move that you know you can punish with DI what do you do when you land it charge back heavy punch into back heavy punch into heavy dema and then into one of the enders that we just looked at if you hit the very tip of the DI the second back heavy punch can whiff but that really doesn't happen that often most of the time you're going to hit you know a lot closer to them the visual cue for this it can be a little bit tricky i just think about when the camera like starts to pan back to normal that's when I start holding the charge back heavy punch next up I just want to look at some of her normal hit situations so off of light she really has to route into light dema it's pretty much all she gets that can be from a crouch light kick starter or a crouch jab starter otherwise from her medium punch she has this target combo and generally midcreen you're going to want to go into this medium dema because it keeps them close and gives you oki for a mixup for example if you don't have a lot of drive left and you want to cancel level three you're going to have to go into medium gladius and if you have plenty of drive left you can go into ODMA which is going to have the same routes that heavyda had plus one important one which is a drive rush into this heavy kick target combo and from there we have a couple different options kind of the O key ender here is doing this jump medium punch and then we can like walk up throw or walk up button and get a mixup or if you want to cancel level three you can go into light gladius the other conversion that I think is a BMBB for her is this crouch medium punch buffer into drive rush you route into her medium kick which then links into back heavy punch and then again heavy dema and you can do whatever ender you like from there really only has a few counterhit situations that I think are very important to talk about so the first of those being crouch jab into stand light kick and this is new to season 3 this didn't used to work and you can route that into light demo this is good because there are certain situations where if this crouch jab hits from further out you can't link another one you'll whiff but the stand kick does connect in kind of the same vein stam medium kick counter hit into a sand light kick is good you can see there are ranges where it'll still drop the light dema but that's a lot more consistent than it used to be and then the only two other situations on counter hit that I think are important to know about are from her towards medium punch which will counter hit link into crouch jab and then her stand heavy punch counter hit links into crouch jab and both of those are kind of the same idea which is you're just kind of fishing for them you know you're trying to catch them pressing something while they walk forward and you see counter hit you under crouch jab otherwise she's not a big counterhit type character okay so that's going to be about it for the combos that you absolutely need to know on counter hit lastly I want to talk about Mara's punish counter conversions so we'll start with her stand heavy punch ends up being plus seven on punish counter so she can link into her stand medium punch and then into whatever ender you want odma is usually pretty good if you uh have drive gauge to spare similarly if you're just kind of fishing or counter poking you can throw out that stand heavy kick and get very good reward because she can do drive rush into this towards heavy kick target combo and then she has a couple options from there so the hey I don't want to spend any more meter on this medium DMA into sweep good damage good oki actually from anywhere on screen because you can always do dash up into towards heavy kick and in the corner it's especially good but she can also spend a little bit more drive here and go for something that looks like that right and then she can really extend off of that and you see that was almost full screen corner carry 4,000 damage pretty decent situation for you and then there are the things that really make you want to play the character which is the ridiculous DP punish damage so in the corner this is the combo that I like to do if I block a DP and I have all my resources to spend okay and that's going to be 7,700 uh after the level three so what that is is that is towards heavy kick OD quad back heavy punch drive rush back heavy punch drive rush towards heavy kick target combo and then charged back heavy punch into heavy gladius and what I like about that is it's not exactly her max damage corner out but it works with like less than full drive so if I just have a little bit more than like four bars this will work and the max route you kind of need all six to start with so it's nice in that it's a little bit more meter conservative as well if you are backed up the absolute max damage you can do is actually going to start with a charged crouch heavy punch into charge back heavy punch that can happen if I walk if you walk back da da da da there we go this will work and there I charge that accidentally a little bit so it can be a little finicky and it only works kind of at point blank but you go into like ladius and it is almost 7k without CA from anywhere on screen if you are concerned that oh I'm not sure about the range maybe it'll whiff then you can go into this driver cancel medium kick back heavy punch driver cancel medium kick back heavy punch heavy dema and then heavy gladius will juggle there i was just a little bit late that loses about 300 damage but it's a lot more consistent it also highlights the point that if you land something and you're looking to cash out and you're not near the corner at all you really want to do dry rush cancels instead of like a dimma for example so if I landed this my max damage would be all on the ground here right and that'll be over 6,000 damage which again is really good for a you know 12 frame whiff punish but you'll see if I did something like heavy dema here that's like 100 less damage so you want to keep them on the ground if you can unless they're in or near the corner in which case you want to get them with OD quadriga because it just does so much damage and it's going to extend right so if you can ever go into OD quad you want to go into OD quad if you can't keep them on the ground okay again is this every combo she can do no but it'll definitely get you started if you're picking up the character or if you're coming back after a long time away hopefully this is helpful as always have a good time
