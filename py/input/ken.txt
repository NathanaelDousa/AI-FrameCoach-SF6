hey what up YouTube this is izong thanks for tuning in after Kimberly Rio and Marissa I got you a full guide on Ken Masters over 20 minutes long we're gonna build up his game plan starting in neutral in his anti-airs building it up with all of his normals all of his specials supers dry brush Drive Impact punishes anything you can think of I got you so give it a thumbs up and let's take this full screen all right all right start off the guide in the neutral position Ken is a very quick character who has these Fireballs to control neutral he also has a run stop so he can run at people and pressure them he also has a good Dash good walk speed so he's a jack of all trades with different mix-up options built in from his special moves he's a deceptive character with a lot of space control now talking about space control this medium kick dominates neutral this has a lot of range almost goes half screen and you can easily confirm that into another medium kick heavy kick his Target combo and that'll knock him down if people block this they eat some Drive gauge damage and it's minus five so you're completely safe if you space it well the thing is that if somebody drive impacts you're going to get crushed so it's important in neutral to not just use medium kick but also mix in the stand heavy punch and crouching medium kick because those two buttons are special cancelable meaning you can also special cancel into your drive impacts here real crushes our stand medium kick but if he does that to our stand heavy punch we can Mash driving with ourselves and put a lot of damage on him same deal for crouching medium kick if you throw that out in neutral and somebody mashes Drive impacts you will be in time to recover you can punish them for a lot of damage there we go almost three thousand so in neutral use that Medium kick also be mindful and use your heavy punch and your crouching medium kick a little further away you use these fireballs and what you'll see happening is that people are gonna be jumping and if they jump at you you have the sure you can forward down forward punch fully air Invincible or you're crouching heavy punch a pretty good anti-air normal to use if people jump at you and they won't jump at you once or twice they're gonna jump at you five times per round guaranteed now if you anti-air them a lot and throw a lot of these fireballs and a lot of medium kick people will start blocking and if you see that they become passive you can either run stop at them or you can use your dragon lash kick forward down forward heavy kick if people block that you're gonna be Plus in their face you can also use your run into the kick we'll look into that later but you have a lot of tools to punish people who are scared of your fireballs you can also Drive Russian of course from crouchy medium kick or just raw you have different options because Ken is so fast and if you throw them you will put them in a throw Loop so you can keep punishing people for being passive so it'll have to be running at you or jumping at you and then he has his game plan right he has his fireballs and he has his uppercut some in-game footage here to punish on Cami with the medium kick medium kick heavy kick there's the anti-air Fireball [Music] he actually gets punished for mashing and there she's trying to throw Tech and that is a shimmy and that is a perfect knockout forget about all the combos it's more about the space control where I am on the screen about um let's say one-fifth away from him throwing these fireballs and just anticipating him to drive rush in or jump in and I can punish both options I'm gonna go they'll put him in a corner and we can throw them throw Loop but I won't be going in again just leave some room from the jump out that's the uppercut again and then a low check into the uppercut and that crouching light kick is a great starter if you look at his normals and his links so that's a Natural Bridge to the next chapter his crouching light punch and a stand light Bunch both four frame options the fastest button in the game they combo into each other and scratching light punch is even plus five on hit meaning it can also go into a stand light kick and its stand medium punch so crouching light punch is something you want to be landing right get your combo started from a four frame button now crouching light kick is also really good because it hits low we just saw me use that against Jaime so a string you want to be practicing is crouching live kick crouching light punch standing light kick into a special move people need to respect that they need to block there and if they do block you can start throwing people because all these buttons leave Canon throw range next up is medium punch this is a five framer very quick for medium it's special cancelable so you can go into Fireballs or other options and it's also part of his backbone combo structure is medium punch heavy punch Target combo which is also special Constable into any special move you want it leaves people into a Juggle State and you can go into your run into your maximum damage combos we'll look into those later now a scratching medium kick six frame startup crouching medium punch also six frame starter both of them special cancelable so those are really good tools to use as well and is neutral then heavy punch is the start of the show in my opinion this is a great punish tool lots of range special Constable safe on block greater Drive Russian really good button crouching heavy punch is more of an anti-air and an advanced combo tool because you can go into the Run Stop like I'm showing here this is pretty difficult to do so you don't really need that yet start with heavy punch and there is this heavy kick this is very slow this is jumpable and you can drive impacted but if it punishes somebody you'll get a crush counter right it puts people into a float State you can go into the run and then either go into uppercut or Dragon Lash and it's crouching heavy kick is his sweep which is pretty good for an 8 framer so now we know our normals and our links let's have a look at the special moves this is his uh hadoken it's really good in this game only 12 frame startup and up close you can use it as a block string Ender once in a while just make sure you use the light one that's minus seven don't use it too much if you expect somebody to punish that you can use your OD version leaves you at -2 which is safe and in the corner after a Juggle you could even go into a heavy punch uppercut to finish the juggle next up is this tatsumaki quarter Circle back kick the light version can go into a medium uppercut from close range but from a little further like this you see it doesn't juggle as high so you cannot get the upper back so you have to see how you space it the medium one has a great great knock down you can also get it from lights if you dash twice and press your medium punch you will counter hit any button that they put that they press on wake up and his heavy kicked ass so you dash up one so you can press your heavy punch and then go into a combo there we go now the OD uppercut still fully Invincible in this game that it goes through all the texts and it's OD Tatsu is more of a combo finisher has good Corner control and you can even use this after the non-sinematic level 3 super to press them towards the corner we'll look into those supers later now he's Dragon lash we already saw this uh the heavy version is plus one on block so if somebody is becoming passive you can use that heavy Dragon lash kick to put yourself in their face in throw range at plus one really good if it happens to hit somebody or plus three on counter it you can even combo so that's all really good there's just a large gap between using the button and the heavy Dragon lash people can Mash out of it or press drive impact so it's important to also sometimes use your OD Fireball or your light dragon lash because if they press a button you can actually stop them from pressing that button by using a different special so you can condition people that keep blocking oops and if they do block you can use the heavy Dragon lash to put yourself into a plus one situation and just Loop your offense so this is something you can be practicing with your new play if you're a new player just crouching light punch medium punch heavy punch and then the heavy Dragon lash and just Loop that for a while get a feel of how that move works up and over now next up is his genre kick this is a pretty Advanced tool this generic kick has three different follow-ups it can go into a light which hits low it can go into a medium which hits overhead and the heavy one is a launcher now this is something you should be using mostly in the corner this is a combo tool in my opinion because on hit you don't really get a combo there's also a big gap if somebody blocks the gym that I kick and you go into a follow-up you are very susceptible to being hit so you want to use this in a corner if you use the quarter Circle forward light kick you can go into a medium uppercut maybe use the corner Circle forward medium kick you can go into the heavy uppercut so that does more damage but the timing on the medium one is more finicky so I advise you to just stick to the light kick first so quarter Circle forward light kick then forward heavy kick get the medium uppercut and then with the medium punch and press the medium punch again you'll frame trap any action that they use in between a little frame kill we'll look into that in the text section now the OD version will allow you to go into another genre medium this is pretty difficult to do you see me with it a couple of times here we go OD into the heavy kick into a medium yeah and we get the heavy uppercut so that's Max damage here we go what you can also do is the forward medium kick in the corner that'll uh put them in a bounce State and you can get a heavy uppercut there you can even get the OD Dragon lash for Max damage it does take them out of the corner but if you can kill like that it's a good option to have now you can use that gym that I kick in Block strings but I'm not really a fan of doing this I think this is kind of scrubby the Gap there is really big and both against people who know what they're doing are gonna punish you and people who are just mashing or are gonna punish you so it's not really good let's have a look at the run if you press two kick buttons at the same time Ken starts running and he has three different actions from that he can go into the light kick which is a run stop into the medium kick which is an overhead or the heavy kick which is a forward kick which is cancelable into any of his three supers so that's a really good combo Ender because it has a lot of flexibility if he goes to his uppercut from the Run you'll see him get uh these fire Sparks right those will increase his damage from the uppercuts it can also go into the Tatsu which increases his uh Corner carry or into his uh dragon Lash and the dragon lash will side switch and will juggle them so you can go into a heavy uppercut there or into any super and there's the dragon lash Max damage from that good stuff just know that you want to go into the run after they're in a float State and you get the float state by doing medium punch heavy punch the chocolate combo now crouching heavy Punch If you use this in uh dry brush combos or punish combos you can run stop you'll be plus seven you can go into a scratching light Bunch or a stand medium punch for nice combos you saw that in the introduction combo that's pretty Advanced to do you don't really need that you might as well go into the heavy punch so heavy punch Drive Rush heavy punch medium punch heavy punch that's a good punish all right let's have a look at counter hit so I thought you the string right crouching like kick crouching like punch stand light kick into a special right so if people Mash in between there you get a counter hit you can just finish the combo and just know that your string work right so that's good that's about 1200 damage but if you're really expecting them to mash a lot you could go into your crouching medium punch which open UPS this combo routes it does more damage and it gets you a better knock down you can now go into your Medium tattoo for example pretty good now the heavy punch on counter hit allows you to go into your light kick for a combo from pretty pretty far away medium punch counter hit into the medium punch heavy punch Target combo pretty good you can go into the crouching medium pretty good since you're crouching medium kick is only six frame startup that now counter hit combos from both his light punch and crouching light punch that's pretty useful to note and if you're crouching heavy punch counter hits you can drive right you can run in and you can get the more advanced combos there now you'll see a lot of delay checking in this game uh if you step back you can use your heavy punch as a counter you can go into your crouching medium punch you can go into your crouching medium kick or you can just drive rush in and spend some bar there and make sure that you're actually hitting people [Music] that heavy punch is so good look at that look at the damage I put [Music] there we go almost 3 300 damage I advise you to use this one this is what I'm using that this does 200 less damage but it's a lot more secure because it always hits so you see me use it in-game here against Jamie he whips the throw I'm doing heavy punch Drive Rush heavy punch medium punch heavy punch into the Run uppercut nice so that's a Natural Bridge to the next chapter Drive Russian Drive impacts uh Ken is not that amazing from Drive Rush honestly you can use a scratching light kick or a scratching medium punch because those buttons are both Plus on block um the crouching live kick is plus five on hit plus one on block and it's crouching medium punch is plus seven on hit and plus four on block so you can throw if they block it and on here you can get a combo so scratching light kick can go into a scratching light Bunch or immediately into a stand medium punch which is kind of a commitment something like that and it's scratching medium punch that'll leave you at plus seven so that's a lot more time to actually confirm the hit into his medium punch heavy punch Target combo [Music] light options here doesn't do that much damage but maybe I'm spoiled because I played Marissa before this crouching medium punch leaves you at plus seven so more time to confirm and you can go into the medium punch heavy punch and now the damage is getting a bit more respectable at 26 400. 2 900 even if you go into the dragon Lash now there's the heavy punch I showed you already heavy punch dry brush heavy punch and then your target combo into the Run uppercut or the Run Dragon Lash same for crouching medium kick if you drive Rush that you have to go into crouching medium punch not heavy punch so you sacrifice a bit of damage but it's still pretty good now from Drive Impact mid screen you can do the same just go into your target combo into the run into the uppercut but what is better to do is actually going to the jump into the heavy punch that'll put him in the same juggle and now you can go into the Run Dragon lash and that's uh 3140 damage that's good I even advise you to spend some super meter there because it's not that heavily scaled so if you go into a super here you'll get uh 3500 3900 or 4200 depending on which Super you spend now in the corner you can get a little more even you can go into the jump uh heavy punch into the heavy genre heavy follow-up into the heavy DP that's good if you will splat them you can get the crouching heavy punch into the heavy Gene that I follow up you don't have time to jump there alright so now we got normals we got specials we got links we got combos it's time to have a look at his supers and I think it's super soft pretty flexible uh the light one it switches sides and leaves you very very far away from the opponent so I'm not really a fan of this but it does have the invincibility you can use it after a dragon lash you can use it after the run into the heavy kick because all supers go from there work with me please there we go look how far you are away from them and it takes them out of the corner so you don't want to use that in the corner here as well look taking them out of the corner not great his level 2 is more flexible you can get that from light buttons something like that does a bit more damage as well of course this also cancels from a lot of EX moves and it's really fast it's only six frame startups so you can get it from a generous as well even the light juggle and as you see it leaves them in the corner so if you've got somebody in the corner you want to spend super make sure to spend your level 2 or level 3 super there there it also cancels from the run into the heavy kick you can even get it from a OD Fireball you can also get it which is not in this video you can also get it from the light Tatsu juggle now his level 3 super is the animated one you can get this from light buttons of course you can get this from all of his juggles this medium punch heavy punch juggle you can get it from the dragon lash kick the Run Dragon Lash probably optimal damage you can get it from the Run uppercut [Music] you can also get it from all normal uppercuts as well and that's where things get a little bit more tricky because if your opponent is in a Juggle State and you go into the uppercut you will no longer get an animated version so here you see he's still in the juggle and I'm not uppercutting I'm going to the Ross the raw super hair that's an animated one a lot of damage but if you end if you have a Juggle and then go into an uppercut and be aware that you're not getting the animated super you'll get this this you can follow it up with a heavy DP or when we saw an ODI Tatsu already that you can use you can even use the OD Dragon lash here for more damage but at the end of the day you're spending more resources and you get less damage so that's not great [Music] there's the OD tattoo as a finisher good Corner carry but not great let's have a look at some tech and my computer here is overheating so you'll see it stutter a little bit slowing down uh what you can do after a throw in the corner what I like to do is go into a dry brush heavy punch because unblock your plus two and if you throw them immediately they can't really Escape there you can throw them and on hit you can get a big combo going so they can't really Mash there there is nothing they can do basically they have to guess twice between strike and throw if you use the drive Rush there if you have any more Tech please leave it in the comments give it a thumbs up if you enjoyed the video and I'll talk to you on the next one alright enjoy this character thanks for watching peace foreign
