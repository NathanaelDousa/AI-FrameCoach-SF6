foreign YouTube as you guys know there's a new new Street Fighter 6 is out and I've been playing a lot on stream at uh I don't Twitch TV slash item and why so I've been playing a lot of Manon recently and I wanted to do like a top 10 things that you can improve on with Manon so I wanted to do like a quick like tips and tricks kind of video so uh let's get into it right now so as you guys can see I'm in training mode right now the first thing that is super important women on and you know it's kind of the most obvious thing is metal the metals are super important so you get medals from doing basically command grab or uh you get Metals basically from doing command grabs or hitting the hit grabs that I just was we're hitting the hit grab and the more Metals you get the more damage you know monotics are doing from throwing there she goes with 2300 2700 and I believe the last one's 3K yeah 3K so basically finding like any way to sneak in a command grab I've been my classic one I like to do is uh cross job command grab usually works are even like dry brush command grounds still pretty good uh the second thing that I think is super important when playing but not so Manon has a lot of uh Target combos but not has a lot of Target combos a lot of unique attacks uh but the two important Target combos are the the medium punch medium kick and the heavy punch heavy punch Target combo so the medium punch medium kick Target combo leaves you plus two uh right uh the opponent plus two right in their face so here in the easy way to sneak in command grab from right there as soon as you hit this you can literally just go for command grab or any other mix up same with the stand heavy punch heavy punch Target combo your plus three the opponent's right there so you can just always do the heavy command grab and it helps build up the levels in a very simple way kind of like a a pretty basic game plan the third tip with Manana I feel like is really good is you always want to stand in her sweet spot I feel like this right here is kind of like Monon sweet spot you know most characters JP sweet spots like way back here with like guile and then like Kimberly sweet spot's like right here like right in the opponent's face I feel like my non-sweet spot is kind of like here you want to stand at this range so like manage buttons are really good surprisingly enough definitely pretty good for a rappler so here like you can poke with sand heavy punch across medium punch is really good stand medium punch is good stand medium kick is pretty good so she has like a lot of good like neutral pokes to use and like you can just buffer this into dry brush into you know combo into hit crowd to easily get your metal stock very high starting from the beginning of the round the next tip uh tip number four uh her anti-air so manon's anti-air game is kind of strange I I would say her antennas aren't as straightforward as a lot of the characters are so her basic anti-air is quarter Circle forward kick uh it's a good anti-air you know it gets you damage you can Dash forward and get like another setup after uh she also has the OD kicks almost called the ex the OD kicks anti-air which you can get into a metal level so that's good if you want to build up your metal I recommend doing this really early on in the match because building on Metals is obviously really important and her third anti-air which I don't do too often so I guess if you're really good at the video game you can do back heavy punch as soon as I time it back heavy punch into that which gives you a lot of combo opportunity so you can do back heavy punch uh back heavy con back heavy punch uh heel into OD heal into drive rush into spin and get a lot of damage like that now you kind of have to be insane to do this I really don't go for this myself but she does have a lot of unique anti-air combo those are kind of uh the he has good anti-air tools and the obvious one is always crouched heavy punch that brings her down the Crouch heavy punch Target combo that brings them back in for a mix so you can kind of just Loop it say they jump again even after you get an anti-arginine the other thing that's important woman on I would say abuse Drive rush and this is kind of more of like a street fighter six tip more so than uh what you call it but definitely a abuse the drive system the drive system in this game is insanely strong so one thing I like to do after command grab drivers cross medium punch you're uh after this you're plus 10 so if it hits you can link into the stand heavy punch Target combo which I just dropped let's try this again yeah so you can kind of loop the command throw pressure kind of like that if they keep getting hit by this but you can't do it too early or else it'll be really far away like that and also Drive Perry which is going to be very hard for me to show off because I'm not very good at Perry first place so if you get a perfect pair like that you can easily just get a level up kind of like that so yeah use the drive system definitely to get your Metals up really fast I I the perfect hair is kind of hard to land also um another another tip would be think of the long game I I do this a lot and I feel like people don't really realize it I'm only thinking of the long game if there's like a round where like hypothetically I'm at 100 life and my opponent's at like 10 life like and like okay I have like two medals and I'm like okay I can do kind of something stupid to kind of build up my level system or like try to get my opponent to or or try to perfect carry something my opponent does to get my level system it's it's a good and a bad thing because I definitely feel like keeping your levels for like the next couple of rounds going up is super important so if you have a huge life lead I would say do something and try to get your metal level up uh really early think about like the next two rounds or even the next round in general another trick I would say think about the level one and level two Cas I know everyone who wants to combo into the level three la la la super but I do feel like the other supers are pretty important too so this is like the go-to like I'm gonna win the game Super but even if you're like cornered here I would say using the level one to get out of the corner is really good so you can like easily turn the pressure up because I think the corner is really strong in this game or even the level 2 super always beware if your opponent's dry meter so if they have like one bar and you can do a combo like this for example burn out your opponent if I I did that right hang on 0.5 okay and my last tip I would definitely say um definitely check out the check out the character guys I actually think Capcom did a pretty good job with all the character guys and tutorial I did a lot of manon's character guys it definitely teach you how to play the character to like a very surprisingly high level I definitely think the character guys are definitely develop to get people like diamond and higher a lot more and the combo trials are useful useful as well I just asking kind of like all them enough trials already so yeah so that's kind of my my basic my basic kind of like tips and tricks of Manon uh I I'm still learning the character kind of like I'm learning the character like the rest of you guys so it's definitely kind of hard I'm definitely putting in a lot of hours trying to figure out even what's going on with this game because I definitely think this game's a lot more to think about in terms of like mechanics and stuff compared to like Street Fighter four and five so yeah let me know what you guys think uh be sure to uh subscribe to the YouTube channel no that's that always helps and I will see you guys next video peace
