honda Ultimate Beginner Guide honda's main focus is definitely going to be around his headbutt and butt slam these special moves are super spammable so the deal with headbutt is that it is a forward advancing move covers the full screen if you can do heavy um and medium and goes a little bit less further and light the least far but the thing about it is that this move is safe on block so even if people block this move they're not going to be able to punish it so this is only negative -3 unblock and most of the fastest moves in this game are four-frame jabs you do a light head button here they try to press a button you can block in time so it's a very spammable move in that sense and if they block it see look at their drive gauge it starts dropping like crazy they can't just sit here and block the whole time because it's going to deplete their drive gauge very quick they're going to end up going into burnout and losing so they're incentivized to do something about this so you can kind of set the pace with that and the thing about the butt slam is it's kind of similar to the headbutt but you can actually get plus frames on this so this is plus you're not left that close to them if they block it on the way down but you move first you're plus one so you see here if I do like jab it's kind of hard with the spacing to really demonstrate this but you at least Yeah you can beat their button right but the main thing about it is that it leaves you also at like a really spaced out spacing so for the most part if people block this they're going to walk away from you which means you can do something like this heavy punch here as well so if they try to actually press a button foolishly you can do that they're going to whiff like all their fast buttons that they could try to do to challenge you would whiff at this range so you can just do this and the thing I'm doing with the butt slam is you control the direction in the air so if I just let this rip he goes about that far if I do the lightkick version but if I hold back it actually steers it back and he goes more to the left and if I hold forward he goes much more to the right so every time you do the butt slam you kind of want to steer it to the direction that the opponent is in so if you're doing it from far away to get in you want to hold towards the opponent to get close to them and if you're right next to them you kind of want to steer it back hold back to just land in front for example so if you do like the the heavy one here and hold away you can get over them there's some angles where like you'll just fly over them like if you miss them on the way up you can kind of just completely miss them so you want to steer it basically you want to control that you can also you can bait anti-airs by making it not approach but that's a little high level so spam this right you can even do things like crashing medium punch into it over and over it's just so spammable now your main normals on the ground game if if people are just running to your head butts and butt slam literally just keep doing this until they die if they start clamming up and actually block and and are dealing with your your headbutts and butt slam this is your go-to move this move is plus on block and has amazing range at so at this like the this range here you can kind of just spam it it is so spammable it's absurd such a spammable move right if you're up close you can do that into the medium punch into like crash and light punch here see it's actually a plus you'll beat them trying to challenge after and then you can just do like this into jab jab and then do it again and then do it again do it again and you can drive rush in and do it so this move is godlike amazing move the other godlike move in neutral once they start climbing up and trying to like defend is towards heavy kick this is a low this move it it hits them low from really far away they have to block it low so the what it catches is people trying to walk away from you when you're headbutting people over and over they're going to try to walk away from you to build space so you can just do this so you can even do things like after the butt slam do the forward heavy kick so stand medium punch and forward heavy kick are the two most common buttons I'm using in neutral and then heavy punch is the next one heavy punch has less range than like towards heavy kick I would say and maybe similar range maybe a little bit more than stand medium but what it does here is it catches people trying to press things cuz like it does that if if they whiff something and you sl slap them you can get a full combo and uh you you can definitely mess them up for that and this is also going to be your combo starter if they're finally going to block command grab them half circle back with kicks you can do that like dry brush into medium punch on block normally and then do half circle back kicks that's another common thing so either dry rush medium punch into that half circle back and kick or drive dry rush medium punch into the jab medium the command grab will catch them if they're just sitting there blocking forcing them to move and then this will catch them if they're trying to jump away so it's basically a mix they have to guess between if you're going to go for command grab or for this right away so easy mix main combos to know now that you have the basic game plan with those options you want to know like if they DI they're finally gonna DI if they're getting antsy from you harassing them over and over and DI gets Honda gets them killed so a basic combo I think is just if you land the counter DI it's going to be heavy punch into your quarter circle forward kick move and then you hit uh down during it and then mash punches and then that launches them and then after that launcher you're able to go into heavy hands boom basic combo now an even simpler version of that is you can just hold back during this and just do heavy punch to heavy headbutt right you're going to try to keep it ultra simple um basically the heavy punch or heavy punch to heavy hands right just that and that that you can cancel into your level three so you want to have this basic nice and easy combo for this kind of situation so like heavy punch to heavy hands level three the other thing is that also applies of course like if you block an uppercut uh you can just do heavy punch heavy hands obviously this is like super suboptimal but it's nice and reliable if you're like a beginner and not comfortable with the combos yet you want to get your damage in when you can um and you can make it more complex once you know are more comfortable with the inputs and go into things with the launcher for example and extend more other than that I think what you're going to do also is when you knock them down you do want to dry brush in to pressure them a lot um I think one of the common things that I did for uh this run to master was I went drivers crushing MK on the Oi which I thought was pretty good so if if you do if you knock them down say like that dry rush crouching medium kick is a nice starter and then it goes into the stand light punch stand medium punch charg combo so up close if you're getting like pressure from this I generally just do drive rush into crouching medium kick and that will combo if it hits to the light punch medium punch short combo and I just cancel that to headbutt and even if they block that like even if they happen to block that sequence this is still just safe on block it's absurd so if you get in for pressure from dry rush getting from like the crashing medium kick into the stand medium punch stand light punch stand medium punch char combo to headbutt is safe and then even also for this the drive rush stand medium punch which is absurdly plus another way to get in it doesn't hit them low so it doesn't open them up unless they're like mashing buttons this is super plus it's your turn you can do like two of those or you can do like even this they have to hold all of that so kind of like get your plus move with the dry rush in there or like just a single stand medium punch and then do the medium punch light punch combo into headbutt and reset and then after you reset the headbutt you know you can go back to doing the tors heavy kick to approach this all the while make sure to go back to keeping charge i mean playing a charge character means during all these instances I'm always like keeping in mind my charge sometimes I'll even just knock them down and just do this or like I'll just keep doing butt slam in their grill you know I'm keeping charge every time I press a move I go immediately back to down back that way I'm always building charge so whenever a a whiff animation is going on or an attack animation is going on whenever my character is stuck in a state where I like nothing I press influences his actions for a little bit I start holding down back so that way after like towards heavy kick for example I'm immediately holding down back after I press it and then I can immediately butt slam after so that's just getting familiar with charge um having charge always will make it so that you can spam his spammable moves and uh that's Honda for beginners
