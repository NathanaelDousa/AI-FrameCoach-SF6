hey what up YouTube this is isun thanks for tuning in in today's video I'm giving you guys my eighth full character guide for Street Fighter 6 and today we're going to dive into the world of Luke in 22 minutes I'm going to completely break this character down so that you can take him online and play him quickly we'll go over his normals his specials his Drive Rush Drive Impact supers and all kinds of tech that I AMS if you enjoy it give it a thumbs up but let's waste no more time and take it full screen all right thanks for watching all right let's start off the guy with a character overview what kind of character is Luke well he's a jack of all traits and a master of some he is very mobile has a good 19 frame Dash a really really fast Fireball and he has a bunch of incredible pokes so in neutral he is dominating look at that heavy punch medium punch there uh stand medium kick also really good so if he gets a block string on you and he pushes himself out of range uh you are the one who's probably out of range and not Luke so you're a character with a good Fireball and lots of good pokes people are going to jump on you he has the rising upper just a regular Dragon punch and crouching heavy punch which is one of the best one button NTI in the game for special moves he has this uh flash knuckle light medium and heavy and the cool thing about this is that it has a just frame timing so if you land a crouching heavy punch in your combos you can charge a light or a medium flash knuckle and if you do that uh you can get perfect there you can get a nice combo which brings us to the next feature of Luke he does a lot of damage and a lot of corner carry this is almost 6,000 and I missed one perfect timing there and it was not even a CA so really damaging character he also has this back happy punch worth the mention this is a throw bait moves him back a little bit and this is one of the most fun buttons in the game in my opinion how does that look in game you got the Fireballs to put people into a passive State they start blocking and defending uh opens up the lane for a drive rush or a jump for instance you only need one hit to put him in a corner and if you have a level three on board you're going to do a lot of damage so we're 10 what 9 seconds on the way he's almost dead already and you're done that is looking a nutshell now let's break it down have a look at his normals first his crouching light punch or one of the better ones in Street Fighter 6 in my opinion four frame start up plus four on hit you can get three of them on block and on hit so it's an easy confirm and it chains into its other lights like it's crouching light kick these work together so crouching light punch crouching light kick crouching light punch that is a string you want to be trying because that frame traps against both strikes and throw and you can cancel into a fireball or follow up with a medium kick or medium Punch or heavy punch because even though he's far away Luke's normals dominating neutral so these are spacing traps that are going to be working for you stand light punch moves them forward part of a Target combo light punch medium punch heavy punch and that is special cancelable you need to special cancel that on block so either go into a fireball into an OD Fireball or you can go into a Charged heavy flash knuckle that'll leave you plus four on block so it's Ste your turn here and that is susceptible to drive impact a lot of people drive impact there so if you go for your OD Fireball there's a little mini game there where you are in time to recover with your own Drive impacts and next up stand light kick uh pretty good at stopping Drive rush I should use this a little bit more crouching medium punch this is a god button this has a great hit box very small her box hard to whiff punish a lot of complaining about this button because it's also plus one on block and it's plus five on hit so it's actually a frame trap into a scratching light punch and also a confirm into a scratching light punch so you want to use those buttons together so un blocked you might want to attack their Drive Gauge by going into a fireball on hit you want to do a light flash knuckle which is a really good knockdown o flash knuckle for a little bit more damage also a pretty good knockdown so lots of options from the watchingg medium punch really good button stand medium punch has insane range and if you see them press anything and you see it's a hit you can confirm into your uh medium punch medium punch medium punch medium punch Target combo doesn't do a lot of damage but it's a good knock down you can uh Dash up and press your press your heavy kick medium kick already saw it is only seven frame start up it's uh it's not cancelable and it's susceptible to drive impact but they're just guessing if they do that it has excellent r range and if we do our little uh three light string here Luke's going to be pretty far away at minus two uh he can press his 10 medium kick there that'll um punish counter if they whiff anything but if they jump he can still recover and do his uh light Rising Upp or there that's a good button to use after that string once in a while crouching medium kick also a god button this button Clips you low only eight start up and he can um he can just drive Rush after that so what you're going to be doing a lot is crouching medium kick fishing uh cancel into the drive rush into crouching medium punch crouching heavy punch and then you can charge your flash knuckle and finish the combo put him in a corner with one hit the forward medium punch is his overhead it's pretty slow but it's good if you use it from Drive rush cuz it's going to be plus six on hit you can go into your crouching medium punch and get a nice combo going put him in a corner from an overhead always a good thing to [Music] do stand heavy punch one of the best single buttons in Street Fighter 6 in my opinion this is cancelable only 10 start up with Incredible range if you whiff this you're going to die but it's hard to whiff actually this is really good so you can cancel into anything you want right get some good stuff going from that throw it out once in a while if you're expecting them to move forward then the back heavy punch we already talked about this this is a throw bait and this is such a fun button uh it's just really slow on startups so you get thrown out of it sometimes even though it's a throw bait so you want to be using it after having a lot of Advantage so what you can do is you can like Drive Rush crouching medium punch that's plus five and then you follow up by the the back heavy punch and if that hits It's a punish counter so you're going to get a lot of damage from that really fun to land that in game crouching heavy kick is sweep it's 10 startup and minus 9 on block so it's it's it's all right to punish people I guess I wouldn't be sweeping back if you block a sweep that doesn't work against all characters and his stand heavy kick uh varies from plus two on hit to minus five on block but you can space it to get better Frame data on that so there this is plus two but from further away you can get it to plus four like here that's even plus six on hit because you hit it on the last active frame so there are a lot of setups where you can use it like after your medium punch medium punch Target combo and dash forward and pressure heavy kick we'll look into more of those setups um in the tech session the tech section all right uh on coun a punish counter you can go into your supers or into your heavy uppercut because it it will launch them like a crush counter uh so does a back heavy kick puts him in a stagger State you can drive Rush forward into crouching medium punch get a combo going from there for one bar but you can also go into your stand heavy punch into your run shoulder or even into your OD run shoulder because that cancels into your level two we look at that uh in the super department but that's 5,000 damage for only two bars super good uh then his forward heavy punch sorry for The annotation at the bottom it's forward heavy punch of course and this is a save on block minus three but you can confirm that into a Target combo and that is special cancelable so you can go into a OD flash knle for example or on block you need to cancel into let's say a fireball or OD Fireball because this is very negative on block not a huge fan of this button he has other buttons that have the same range like St heavy punch crouching medium kick it to crouch heavy punch this is a target combo this is really good because this will clip uh back walkers and you can confirm that now it's special moves of course the sand blast uh this travels so fast it doesn't uh really start up that fast it's slower than Ryu and Ken but people are afraid to jump on this because travel so fast Works nice in conjunction with his uppercut like a true Sho if you want to use it on block I suggest you use the heavy one gives you the best frame Advantage yeah it's minus five but if you do a heavy one then you're going to be plus two right you can harass people with that follow it up with a heavy punch because that reaches from so far away the OD sand blaster will knock you knock down the opponent so no Drive rushing behind his Fireballs can also use it in a corner after a charged um flash knuckle you get the perfect one you do a medium one and then a heavy uppercut if you don't get the perfect one you do a medium one and then a light uppercut these are his Splash Knuckles you use the light one from lights gives you a really nice knockdown can drive Rush overhead from that they cannot Escape that like that that's plus seven on hit so you can combo into your crouching heavy Punch or crouching medium punch the medium flash knuckle you can uh get that from Crouching medium Punch or from heavy [Music] and the heavy flash knuckle you get that from Crouching heavy punch in Stand heavy punch now if you want to charge a light in your medium one for the nice combos you need to land a crouching heavy punch so that's either on a punish counter because crouching heavy punch is very negative on block you get that from a punish counter or from a drive Rush combo you can charge your medium flash knuckle then charge your light flly flash knuckle and you can end there with the with the heavy flash knuckle if you get the perfect light one one so that's a heavy but if you don't get the perfect one you can go for the medium so this is perfect so we'll do the heavy one [Music] there the OD flash knuckle cancels from all cancelable buttons uh you can use this a lot from lights to get a little bit more Corner carry more damage you can end the combo with either a heavy uppercut or a medium flash knuckle or a super of course uh you're level one and your level three we then here's the uh the rising upper of course saw that already couple of corner combos here from The Flash knuckles good stuff now Rising upper you can use this in combos but you can only use it if you're close by so after two hits for example or after landing they uh charge medium flash knuckle you can use the heavy uppercut gives you good Oki the OD version is fully invulnerable but this is mostly an anti-air as a combo finisher it just doesn't have a lot of range might as well go for the flashs now he has this run qu Circle forward kick and he can cancel into either a punch which uh is a shoulder like that or a kick which is a overhead both of them are minus one block the shoulder is minus 6 and you can space it to get it to minus two even to zero I've seen situations where it's zero so you can play around with that a little bit don't really need that at first and the overhead that's very minus on block minus eight I think and it's kind of gimmicky don't really use that much the OD shoulder is one frame faster it's also armored so it can go through a projectile and uh you can cancel it into your level two for a lot of cornner carry and a lot of damage for only two bars so I think that's really good where you get a conversion like that if you don't have a level three on board with that 4500 they're in the corner you're going to be plus three if you land this in the corner you're going to be plus three immedately with crouching medium punch well there's your heavy flash knuckle an all right knockdown we see this combo before already really good carry and doesn't spend a lot of resources that's good and if you got him in a corner you can go into a medium Fireball into a uh light uppercut and if you get the perfect one you can also get a light flash knuckle into a light uppercut or an OD uppercut like that so that's good stuff if you will splat them you have to do back happy punch into the perfect flash knuckle and and again there is the medium Fireball into the heavy [Music] uppercut you can also cancel into your level two after the light flash knuckle using the the Fireball the medium Fireball into the uppercut that's the easiest way to start off in the corner let's have a look at Drive Rush he can of course Drive Rush row low with crouching light punch that'll combo into his crouching light punch twice so that doesn't do a lot of damage but but it helps people stand up and if they stand up you can get them with your overhead your drive Rush forward medium punch really good of course you can also throw them but you can also then bait that throw by doing Drive rush back heavy punch so he has a lot of options he also has the crouching medium punch that is going to be plus five on block so this is a really good situation actually shimmy them from good damage so he's very dangerous from Drive rush in my opinion he uses the mechanics really [Music] well already saw this earlier in the video Drive Rush crouching medium punch on block plus five can put your back heavy punch behind that and get a uh get a nice like Auto shimmy from that let's have a look at knockdowns from this light flash knuckle you want to do the forward medium punch uh that hits uh as an overhead and it hits mey so they can back dash they can't Mash out of it they can't jump out of it they have to block or Parry that so if you can get them to block a Perry you can start throwing them you can start setting up your other options after a normal throw you want to drive Rush stand medium punch that's going to be plus one on block so you can immediately throw him after that and on hit you can get a crouching medium punch and get a nice combo going even crouching heavy punch is available so look at that it's a lot of damage for pressing after a throw 6,000 damage because you try to do anything after getting thrown you have to take [Music] that so after a throw as well if you condition them to not uh Mash you have to crouch light punch going get the crouching medium punch going stuff like that right because he has so many different options he can always open you up with a high with a low with a throw or with a shimmy now if you want to dump your meter you can get a crouching light punch a drive Rush crouching light punch and that crouching light punch can go into the crouching heavy punch that's how you can get the party started with the charge flash knuckles if you want to dump all your stuff there you just do crouching light punch crouching light punch Dy Crush scouching light punch crouching heavy Punch If you get heavier buttons like a crouching medium kick you go into the crouching medium punch the goal is to always go into the crouching heavy punch so you can get your charge Splash Knuckles off now let's have a look at the supers they're really really good they can all cancel from uh from light buttons all three of them uh just beware that his level two only connects after two hits it doesn't have the same range as his level one and his level three now his level one is Godlike I'm going to show you that one here so you can use that in combos you can use that as a wake up because it's really fast if you want to use the level two after the OD moves you want to cancel those OD moves so don't wait until they're in the air you have to immediately cancel into the level two and you can get the level three from all of his flash Knuckles to work too slow something like [Music] that all right now I have Ken here recorded to throw a hadoken at us let me show you how good his level one is that'll go straight through punish counter right so the first hit nullifies the projectile and then the second hit goes through and he punishes him level three as well really really good a couple of setups here in a corner to get your level two off you can do a jump medium punch with a delayed aerial flash knuckle you have to practice this I don't really use this much because you can do the same thing from a uh Fireball that goes into the level two as well level one also nice you can also get it from from a light flash knuckle light flash knuckle and go into your level one or your level two here good stuff really good supers let's go to the tech department um want to show you some optimal Corner carry stuff here you want to end in the Run shoulder really good knockdown plus 15 on back recovery you can just walk forward and throw them so that's good you can also uh whiff the shoulder if you do it from a non-perfect uh your plus five if you do it from a perfect light flash knuckle you're going to be plus seven in their face so you can either strike throw or shimmy them so that looks really really cool if you can shimmy them from that look at this in game back heavy punch Drive Rush forward crouching medium punch crouching heavy punch bang that's a lot of damage for you trying Teek a throw I thought of a couple of frame kills here after the light flash knuckle you can whiff a stand medium punch and if you do that you're going to be plus four in throw range so they immediately have to guess between attacking a throw and striking so from this situation you can do anything you want right strike throw or shimmy have him wake up with a button here let me demonstrate that you can throw him out of his button and of course you can also combo right here counter hit crouching medium punch Here Comes the Pain good setup now I'm going to show you also how to use that meaty heavy knee we saw that this was actually minus five on block you can get it five frames better than it is by whiffing a crouching light punch into the stand uh heavy kick there you go plus seven on hit wasn't even a counter hit right so on counter hit this is plus nine so after this you can get your crouching heavy punch crouching medium Punch or just going to lights if you want to really take some more time to confirm bang look at that a lot of damage meterless and some more meter [Music] here some in-game footage here so after the heavy uppercut we whiff the we do the crouching light punch there yeah and then stand heavy kick baby and she's dead so that was plus s on plus S I think yeah there's Oki with the medium punch plus four we throw him out of his button and he's done game over so these are some nice frame kills for you to use and I hope that helps you in your game if you enjoyed this content give it a thumbs up if you uh want to leave your uh ideas about how to play Luke in the comments be my guest and I'll see you on the next video all right thanks for watching peace [Music]
