uh hello uh welcome to my Aki guide this has been a project that I've been working on for a while now people have requested it it's uh this is also I should mention this is a sub uh request from my stream so thank you to everyone who subbed it was a sub goal for a while um so let me let me start from the beginning uh who am I um if you don't already know if you're not familiar um I'm brosi um longtime Street Fighter player um I've been involved in the fgc for a very long time I've been an akie main since the day she came out um she just kind of clicked with me you know I've been competing with akie for a while I've done you know lots of cpts you know I want a CPT with Aki I got you know Legend ranks so that's kind of like my background I'm I consider myself to be like uh I don't know an aie expert if that doesn't sound too arrogant uh but yeah so I'm I'm doing a guide here for everyone who wants to learn how to play Aki um so let's start off with why play Aki I think Aki is really fun um it's it's hard for me to recommend a character for reasons beyond that she's very rewarding she's the kind of she's a bit technical but she's the kind of character who like has more and more layers of depth the more time you put into her and I really like that that's my kind of character where you never feel like you're done learning stuff you know she's she's always got something new to find um in terms of Aki's archetype people ask like what kind of play style does she have it's hard to pin down she doesn't really play like anyone else in the game I can't really say she's got she fits into like a um an existing archetype so um the best way I describe her play style is she's kind of hit and run she can play very slow at distance and then she can suddenly very quickly get in and be very explosive up close and then easily get back out again so she's kind of like she's a character that you play at two speeds generally you either you either Rush down or you back off and you want to constantly be switching between those two speeds um if you played Fang I get some questions sometimes about does she play like Fang because she is Fang's Apprentice in uh Street Fighter 5 she has a lot in common with Fang particularly with the poison mechanic which we'll get into later but I actually don't think she plays that much like Fang quite a few Fang players did not move on to akie so if you're an existing Fang player I don't know if I can recommend her but give her a try see what you think um so the structure of this video video is going to be um basically I'm going to be working off an existing document so everything that I say here in this video there is going to be kind of a Bible to go alongside it so if you want to get the uh the written version of all of this because you don't want to try and memorize everything from a video look in the description there is going to be an enormous document with everything that I'm about to say if you just want the pure information written down so I'm also going to have time codes in the video description as well as well so if you want to jump to uh a particular section to to uh find out some specific information then of course that's that's there for a reason um I don't expect anyone to sit down and watch this in one sitting and absorb all that information you know this is meant to be kind of like a a video that you can sort of come back to like frequently you can refer to it you can just watch a little bit and then try and absorb it I don't expect anyone to just be an expert after one watching you know it's it's to be here for a while uh okay terminology and assumptions so making this guide I am going to assume you are not a complete beginner to the entire concept of Street Fighter okay there are better guides than mine if you are completely new to the genre or completely new to Street Fighter and you have no context for like any of this uh I would recommend starting out with some like complete beginner tutorials of just like how to understand the game first before you look before you watch this um I'm going to be using common F GC terminology so if you don't understand the words that I'm saying or the terms that I'm using there's going to be a link down in the description to uh infills glossery which is a really useful resource and it explains in plain English what all the the fgc terminology means so uh yeah use that if you don't know what I'm talking about um I'm also going to be using shorthand names for some moves which I will mention as I go because it will get tiring after a while to say things like uh surf lash when everyone in the community just kind of calls it whip like uh there's a lot of common names for things so like fireable for example coward Crouch but we'll get into those when we cover the moves um in terms of like notation terminology I'm going to be using sort of standard Street Fighter notation for most inputs when I'm talking about them casually so for example quarter Circle forward half circle back terms like this when I'm just generally talking about things but when we get down to actually notating combos I will use numpad notation if you don't know what those things are again you can consult the document in the video description it will explain what those mean uh okay so the context of the production of this video I should also say as of the time of um recording we're currently a few weeks into season 2 uh akie got major Buffs in the balance patch so you know more things may develop over time I can't say that everything I say here is going to be 100% accurate forever you know things change characters evolve things develop but that's where we are right now at time of recording um in terms of future balance patches what I'll probably do in in as they come out is I will record extra videos going over changes in the future as they come hopefully this guide doesn't become too outdated by Future balance patches but I can't predict what Capcom will do but I will definitely do more videos in future to cover any future changes so with that out the way let's talk about system mechanics um most system mechanics in this game are Universal so I'm only going to cover the ones that are uniquely different or have a special property worth mentioning that's specific to akie okay so Drive Rush uh Aki's Drive Rush is extremely fast and it covers an extremely long distance he has one of the best Drive rushes in the game and this is a core part of her neutral game and her combos I mentioned earlier that she's very fast as like a hit-and run character so this is a big part of it you can go from being far away to uh in your face very quickly and very efficiently so uh her drive Rush is very good uh in terms of Aki's Drive Impact it's worth mentioning that this drive impact is actually um unusually disjoint the hitbox for this drive impact extends further than the animation would suggest but generally you don't need to know much about this it doesn't change most interactions it rarely matters because these things are armored regardless but her drive impact is relative to other Drive impacts in the game uh surprisingly uh good in terms of hit boxes but again doesn't really matter that much but worth saying so Aki's throws um her for throw and back throw both do the exact same damage at 1,200 but it is worth mentioning that her back throw gives significantly more knockdown Advantage a forward throw only gives her A+ 19 knockdown while her back throw gives her a plus 27 knockdown I should also mention that her forward throw can be looped in the corner she does have a throw Loop you simply walk forward after each throw this is a manually timed walk forward so um make sure you learn the timing for this you don't want to be hit by your opponent doing wake up normals so generally I would say you only really want to forward thr if it's going to put your opponent in or near the corner so that you can set up her throw loot game if you're in the middle of the screen or your back is to the wall back throw is generally better because of the increased knockdown Advantage okay poison and toxic Blossom uh some of Aki's moves inflict a poison status effect uh this poison will inflict damage over time if you look at the opponent's health bar it's very slowly draining away the total damage of this poison is uh 420 I know the meme the poison status will be removed if Aki takes damage from the opponent it's also worth mentioning that poison damage cannot KO the opponent even while poison they will just stay at 1 HP poison damage interestingly is not subject to combo scaling so if the opponent is is taking poison damage during a combo even if the combo is super scaled and down to like 10% of the original damage the poison damage will still continue to do its full damage and this can be quite important in a lot of situations because the poison damage becomes very noteworthy once you reach Max scaling poison will naturally wear off 7 seconds after being applied if you are not hit out of it however it's very important to keep in mind that the poison status will continue as long as the opponent is in hits done which means that if you start a combo while the opponent is poisoned the poison status will never wear off you don't have to worry about losing poison Midway through your combo even if you pass the 7c mark poison damage will also not take during Aki's level three animation as this completely freezes the timer so you get no additional damage if your opponent is poisoned during this super however do note that her poison damage AG will continue to tick during her level one and level two supers and this is particularly important for her level one which I'll go into more detail later in my toxic Blossom Landing certain attacks on an already poisoned opponent will trigger additional effects these additional effects are known as toxic Blossom these will be covered in detail with each moves break down as I get there do note that there are some moves that can apply the poison status but do not have a unique toxic Blossom effect all right let's break down Aki's normals crouching light punch crouching light punch is a fairly standard four-frame normal it can chain into itself and also into crouching light kick it can also link into her standing light kick which is a very important part of Aki's combo structure on counter hit it can link into standing medium punch and on punish counter or after a drive rush it can link into Stam medium kick or crouching medium punch it's also special cancelable making it a useful combo tool standing light punch standing light punch is a five frame normal making it slower than crouching light punch and it also has slightly less range than crouching light punch it's not particularly useful by itself but it becomes a Target combo when pressed twice this target combo is also a frame trap so you can catch your opponent trying to mash buttons in the middle the forward movement on this target combo where Aki steps forward between the first and second light punch uh makes it the only way to confirm two lights at max range stand light punch also has the lowest recovery of all of Aki's lights uh and this can sometimes confuse people who perfect Parry it it's only plus seven after a perfect par be ready to punish if if your opponent drops their perfect Parry combo jumping light punch jumping light punch is a kind of Niche jump normal it's fast on Startup so you can use it as an air to a due to the fast startup and the fact that it's angled downwards this can actually be used for an instant overhead in certain fuzzy setups but those are about the only uses I've found for that normal crouching light kick crouching light kick is a five frame light that also hits low it can chain into itself and also into crouching light punch crouching Li kick is actually Aki's longest reaching light normal although at distance it's very difficult to convert anything afterwards this normal is mainly useful to catch your opponent low on wake up and it also is very useful as a drive Rush normal given that it will link into standing medium punch afterwards standing light kick standing light kick is a four-frame light but it has longer range than crouching light punch it can also be linked into from Crouching light punch uniquely her standing light kick is the only light attack she has which can combo into medium serpent lash this forms a very important part of her combo structure which we'll get into later on jumping light kick jumping light kick is one of Aki's two crossup normals it's also the only one of the two crossup normals she has that can hit both front and back be aware though that the cross-up hit box is very narrow meaning that it can whiff easily if you're not directly behind the opponent's head also note that the damage and hits done are very low to compensate for the fact that it can hit on both sides you can usually only combo into lights afterwards crouching medium punch crouching medium punch is an eight frame startup medium although note that it has quite a lot of recovery it's quite vulnerable on whiff it has the longest range of her special cancelable mediums it's also the only medium that Aki has that can combo into OD lash without a counter hit or a punish counter this normal is mostly used for whiff punishing and for Drive Rush cancels from neutral standing medium punch standing medium punch is Aki's fastest medium at six frame startup it's also special cancelable this normal has short range relative to the rest of her mediums but it has a good hit box this is also Aki's best normal for intercepting forward moving approaches such as a drive rush it can also link into lights on counter hit opening and it can also link into itself on a punish counter or after a drive Rush note that being six frames also makes this normal extremely good for punishing block drive reversals be careful using this button on whiff as it causes Aki to step forward which leaves her very vulnerable to whiff punishes jumping medum punch this is an upward angled air normal and it's designed exclusively to be used for air to airs on hit it does put the opponent into a Juggle state but if performed early in the jump Ark you rarely get anything afterwards even if you're unable to pick up a combo afterwards you can still take advantage of the knockdown in order to get Oki got you this can even be done from a backwards jump crouching medium kick crouching medium kick is Aki's best low it's seven frame start up unlike a lot of the best crouching medium kicks in this game it's not special cancelable but it makes up for this by being plus one on Block it's one of only two crouching medium kicks in the entire game that are Plus on Block it's also plus five on hit allowing you to link into any light afterwards with Drive Rush Advantage this normal becomes plus five on block and plus nine on hit on block you're plus enough to walk up and get a tick throw afterwards and on hit you can link into stand heavy kick crouching medium kit can also be super canell directly my the window to confirm Crouch medium kick into Super is very small it may be possible for some players with extremely good reactions to single hit confirm this but I can't do it so be careful the main usage of this super cancel is either to counter your opponent's Drive Impact particularly in Burnout or is a hard read on defense if you're sure your opponent is going to go for a shimmy standing medium kick standing medium kick is Aki's longest range medium it's eight frame starter but it's not special cancelable on hit it will link into St medium punch up close it will also link into itself on on counter hit on punish counter or with Drive Rush Advantage it will link into standing heavy kick standing medium kick has an extremely good hit box and a very small hurt box around her feet Aki can easily go over low hit boxes giving her a punished counter when used as a whiff punish like this you can link into Crouch heavy kick Crouch heavy punch level one and level three depending on the Range jumping medium kick jumping medium kick is a situational jump normal it's not particularly useful as an air to ground approach but it can be very good as an air to a against certain dive kicks jumping medium kick can also hit standing characters when done instantly while it's too slow to use this as an instant overhead you can use this as a hard call out option against mey throws do be careful though because if you use it in this way even on punish counter as you see there Aki is still very minus afterwards so I'd recommend only doing this as a way to close out rounds if you're sure your opponent is going to go for a throw crouching heavy punch crouching heavy punch is 10 frame startup and it's a sliding low that acts like a sweep this normal is very good for counter punishing other sweeps even at max range although I do keep in mind that not all sweeps a minus 10 on block so I practice this on a caseby Case basis when Landing is a punish counter Crouch heavy punch will give Aki an extremely long hard knockdown this can be used to set up lots of good Oki situations be careful throwing this normal out though because it's very unsafe on whiff and on block crouching heavy punch is also useful to end some juggle combos when focusing on Oki and Corner carry particularly when performed out of a drive Rush standing heavy punch standing heavy punch is a 12 frame heavy with very long range but it has a lot of recovery it's minus four on block but rarely punishable if spaced correctly standing heavy punch is not special cancelable but it can be pressed twice to give you a Target combo this target combo can be delayed quite heavily allowing for single hit confirms the second hit of the target combo also inflicts poison if the opponent is not already poisoned if the opponent is already poisoned the second hit will activate a toxic Blossom effect and launch the opponent allowing full juggles afterwards this target combo can also be used at the end of some combos to cheaply and efficiently rep poison your opponent jumping heavy punch jumping heavy punch is Aki's best traditional jumping this normal hits very deep vertically it can be pressed early in the jump Ark and will sometimes stuff antier out of their stter overall Aki's jump heavy punch is her best jump in for an air to ground approach crouching heavy kick crouching heavy punch is a 10 frame poke with very good range although despite appearances this normal is not a low crouching heavy kick is not special cable and it doesn't link into anything on hit or on counter hit despite this crouching heavy kick is super cancelable and the cancel window on this normal is enormous this is very very easy to single hit confirm straight into a super it's also noteworthy that when this normal is canceled directly into a super it incurs no damage scaling penalty the super will do 100% of its base damage this is particularly threatening when you have level three stock and can do well over 50% to a fatal degree Master crouching heavy kick is also a very solid anti-air particularly against longrange jumps if it counter hits an Airborne opponent they are left in a Juggle state from far away you can't link anything afterward Wards but close up you can link straight into Crouch heavy punch level one or level three you can also cancel this straight into supers on antiair allowing a combo into level two but note that this is quite risky as you will not get a combo if the opponent did not press an air normal on a grounded or airborn punish counter Crouch heavy kick will launch the opponent a grounded punish counter can give you a Juggle straight into light serpent lash you can also go into a drive Rush stand light kick from any range this makes it very good as a whiff punish on an Airborne punish counter you can connect into drive Rush normals if you hit from far away or juggle straight into quarter Circle back heavy punch up close crouching heavy kick also has above average juggle potential meaning that you can tag it on at the end of some Combos and then cancel into Super standing heavy kick standing heavy kick is Aki's fastest heavy normal at nine frames it's also Aki's only special cable heavy normal standing heavy kick is probably her most versatile normal it's vital for her combo game very good for whiff punishing it's a very solid antiair and it forms a core part of her offensive pressure on hit standing heavy kick is plus four you can link lights afterwards but it's rarely worth doing on counter hit you can link into St medium punch which is situational at best however on a punish counter this move causes a special stagger state which allows you to combo into both heavy kick cruel fate and venomous Fang both of these are very important combo starters the punish counter also adds a large screen Shake effect with extra hit stop that makes it very easy to identify when choosing the right follow-ups on regular hit St heavy kick is Aki's only normal that can combo into coward Crouch roll on block this normal is minus three however this move can be canceled into coward Crouch roll to create a frame trap you can also create a mixup by canceling into coward Crouch grab I wouldn't Mo if I were you however note that this command grab is very slow and not a true tick throw St heavy kick can also be canceled into light snake step in order to reposition bait drive impact and bait Invincible reversals as mentioned earlier Stan heavy kick is a very good anti-air it will cover a lot of angles in front of Aki however be careful as this will consistently lose to cross-ups Jumping heavy kick jumping heavy kick is similar to Jumping heavy punch it has a worse vertical angle than jumping heavy punch and has to be pressed later in the jump AR however it makes up for this by having better horizontal range allowing you to jump in from further out it's also worth mentioning that jump heavy kick does a lot more hits St than jump heavy Punch If pressed as early as possible jump heavy punch is only plus six on hit while jump heavy kick will be plus 9 this is an important distinction because plus 9 is the right amount of frames to be able to pick up a stand heavy kick when you land okay let's talk about command normals starting with down forward medium punch this is Aki's overhead it's slower than most overheads but it sort of compensates for that by having a kind of deceptive animation Aki kind of crouches down at the beginning which can make it not seem like an overhead Aki can pick up a combo afterwards on counter hit unpunished counter and most importantly from a drive Rush due to this overhead being plus three on hit and having three active frames it can also be done as a mey making it plus4 or plus five depending on the setup this is a big part of Corner set play forward heavy punch forward heavy punch is a slow lunging attack with 16 frames of start up but it has very good range it's minus four on block but it's only punishable if done very close on counter hit you can link forward heavy punch into stand light kick and on punished counter you can link into St medium punch although do note that these will not work from max range for heavy punch is super cancelable similarly to crouch heavy kick this can also be single hit confirmed the window is a little bit smaller than Crouch heavy kicks but it's still doable Bo heavy punch also does good damage to the opponent's Drive gauge on block I use this normal a lot to harass people when they're low on Drive gauge board heavy punch is also sometimes used at the end of combos to connect to Super particularly after a medium punch lash crumple forward heavy kick forward heavy kick is a 14 frame startup double hitting hop kick although Aki jumps into the air this move doesn't actually cause her to become airborne however this move can Crush lows from frame 11 onwards board heavy kick is also plus two on block making it a very good offensive pressure tool despite this move hitting twice the second hit will still inherit bonus properties from counter hit and punish counter you can take advantage of the plus frames on this move on Block in a number of ways if you press any light attack afterwards you will get a counter hit if you press standing medium punch afterwards you can force a trade with the opponent's four-frame buttton this trade is usually advantageous enough for Aki that you can actually link another stand medium punch afterwards the only exception this as far as I know is JP in this situation you're only plus five after the trade rather than plus six you can still combo afterwards though on regular hit forward heavy kick is plus four allowing linken to crouch light punch and St light kick it can also link into Stam medium punch on counter hit and Stam medium kick after a punish counter or a drive Rush one thing to note though is that Ford heavy kick as a combo starter adds more scaling than most of Aki's normals you can see here that in this example the Crouch jab after the Ford heavy kick immediately goes to 80% scaling this is not present in her other Heavies Ford heavy kit cannot be canceled into anything and it is quite slow which makes it very vulnerable to to drive impact it is possible to be made di safe using certain meaty setups though forward jump down heavy punch uh this is a fairly unique aerial command normal it's input with down plus heavy punch in the air and it can only be performed from a forward jump Aki attacks in a backwards Direction when using this normal meaning that it can't actually hit your opponent from the front but it is very very good as a crossup it also has a significantly larger hit box than jumping light kick allowing it to hit from angles where normally you'd be unable to cross up it also does significantly more hit stun than jump light kick allowing combos straight into Heavies because of its sharp vertical hit box it can also connect even from a very close forward jump this can even be used as a way to punish your opponent's throw Tech recovery from point blank from very specific angles it is possible to hit this normal as a non-cross up this will still cause Aki to land behind the opponent but it can be very amb uous if spaced properly okay it's time to go through the special moves starting with Sinister slide also known as coward Crouch this specialist performed with down and any two punch buttons and it causes Aki to enter a stance where she slithers across the floor during this stce Aki will automatically move forward until an action is performed or she is hit out of it while in this stance Aki's hurt box is significantly lowered this allows her to avoid most projectiles some normals and even drive impacts Aki is unable to block while in this stance so it leaves you very vulnerable Aki has three special moves that can be performed from this stance and she also can end The Stance early by pressing up be careful though since manually exiting The Stance by pressing up takes 21 frames and Aki cannot block until the animation is complete heal strike also known as coward Crouch roll this special move is performed by pressing any kick button while in Coward Crouch STS it's a two hitting kick and it's also a safe on block at minus three on hit this move is plus4 allowing links into Crouch light punch and stand light kick on counter hit you can link into Stam medium punch and on punished counter you can link into St medium kick this move is a core combo tool for Aki most of the time it will be comboed into directly from standing heavy kick you can also combo into it using a counter hit or punish counter Medi medium punch as mentioned earlier this move is also a frame trap if canceled into from Stand heavy kick beating any normal on Startup additionally if the opponent is expecting you to go for a command grab and they hold up it will also lock them to the floor for a full combo It's Not Over however unlike Ford heavy kick this move is a special move and therefore it can be canel into a level three to protect you coward Crouch roll can also be used in certain juggle combos it's not the most juggle friendly move but it's definitely workable entrapment also known as her command grab how dare you I wouldn't if I were you this move is performed by pressing light punch and light kick while in cow Crouch stance this move is a real command grab meaning that it can't be teched like a normal throw and can only be avoided by jumping back dashing or using invulnerable moves I think this move should be used sparingly due to the high risk but it's an important part of Aki's mixup game I wouldn't if I were you Aki's command grab is is very useful to punish people attempting to either Parry or drive impact your strings especially if you condition them first with coward Crouch roll I wouldn't if I were you it's worth mentioning that Aki's command grab has a very slow animation and it's also worth mentioning that poison damage will take throughout this entire animation which will noticeably boost the damage if the opponent is poisoned beforehand I wouldn't if I were you just as a fun fact this move inflicts 1,852 damage which is an oddly specific amount the reason for that is the unpunished counter this move will inflict 2,222 damage which is a cute little reference to uh Fang's obsession with the number two venomous Fang venomous bang is performed by pressing any punch button while in Coward Crouch starts Aki will dive at the opponent traveling almost full screen and knocking the opponent down on hit Aki is invulnerable to projectiles during almost the entire dive making this move an extremely potent FAL punish be careful though fbls with low recovery can be difficult to punish on reaction especially from long range also this move is extremely unsafe if blocked on hit venomous Fang will also inflict poison if the opponent is already poisoned this move will activate two different toxic Blossom effects depending on the opponent's current state if the opponent is grounded and poisoned the move will crumple them allowing many combo conversions if the opponent is Airborne and poison the move will send into a tumbling State while this state may appear visually similar to a knockdown you should think of it more like another type of Juggle State and you can reliably combo afterwards depending on the situation you can also choose not to continue the combo from this tumble state and instead take advantage of the extremely long knockdown time in order to set up Oki finally venomous Fang can be used as a very situational anti-air it does not have a particularly good anti-air hit box but it travels quickly and it can sometimes snipe full screen jumps particularly against a fireable trap Nightshade pulse also known as akis Fireball this move is performed by using a quarter Circle back plus light punch Aki throws a single projectile this projectile inflicts poison on hit only this fireable has some of the worst Frame data of any projectile in the game at 52 total frames so it often struggles to compete in a traditional Fireball War this fireable is also quite susceptible to jumps and drive impacts myet on the flip side this projectile travels extremely slowly and because of that I think it should be thought of not so much as a zoning tool and more as a shield to safely approach behind particularly when combined with Aki's incredible Drive Rush this can be done both in neutral and as an Oki option Aki's Fireball can canceled into two different follow-ups she can cancel into Nightshade Chaser from frame 30 and she can also cancel into OD snake step from frame 36 these will be covered in more detail with their respective sections Aki's fiable also has an OD version this is performed by inputting two punches instead of one the OD version of Aki's Fireball has two hits rather than one it also has significant ly less recovery and knocks down on hit this FAL functions similarly to the regular one but it's much stronger as both a zoning option and as a shield to approach behind the OD version of fiable is also plus one on block even from point blank making it useful in pressure strings like the regular version of fireable the OD version can also be followed up with either OD night shade Chaser or OD snakes step note that the OD version of nightshade Chaser does not cost any additional Drive gauge it's also worth mentioning that OD Fireball can cancel into OD snake steps slightly earlier than her regular Fireball regular Fireball will cancel on frame 35 while OD fi will cancel on frame 32 this makes it slightly safer against the opponent's anti- projectile moves Nightshade Chaser as mentioned earlier this is a special followup to Aki's Fireballs that is performed with a forward plus punch input it will naturally combo from her Fireball if done up close and this will lead to a knockdown Nightshade Chaser also technically counts as a toxic blossom effect so the poison applied by the fireable will be instantly detonated if the opponent blocks a fireable up close for example when cancelling from a normal Nightshade Chaser will frame trap them this can make it hard for your opponent to take their turn back after blocking a fireball as they'll be scared about the followup strangely this move is actually minor four on hit if it connects from a blocked Fireball meaning that even on counter hit Aki is actually minus two because of the separation distance you're basically put back to neutral though Nightshade Chaser is extremely unsafe on block at minus 16 so don't abuse it even with the very long push back distance almost every character in the game can easily punish it using a drive rush into a four to five frame move sure you some characters don't even need to drive rush to get a punish here one useful use case for this move is to punish opponents attempting to advance on Aki using their Fireball plus Drive Rush combo since your Fireball will clash with theirs and then Nightshade Chaser will intercept them Nightshade Chaser is also useful as a combo Ender in some situations as it will outdamage all versions of serpent lash when followed with a level three this is particularly noticeable at the end of long combos still now here there then here and there my Magnum open as mentioned earlier there is also an OD version of this move but it can only be performed from OD fiable OD Chaser is significantly less useful than the regular version since OD fiable is already Plus on block which removes the need to use it as a frame trap option the only reliable use case I've really found for OD Chaser is as a combo Ender in very specific Max damage combo routes since it can be canceled into both level two and level three supers Orchid spring also known as poison puddle or poison pool this move is performed using a quarter Circle back plus medium punch input Aki places a poison pool in the floor this will inflict the poison status on any OPP opponent that makes contact with it it's also noteworthy that this is the only way Aki can poison the opponent while they're blocking this is Aki's most reliable way to try to poison people from a neutral position although she is very vulnerable while placing the pool it's usually advised to only perform this move from a distance or by using a fireball as protection it can also be safely placed after most knockdowns opponents can be rep poisoned multiple times by the same pole as long as they are standing in it this can allow you to get multiple toxic Blossom effects back to back this is very important for Aki's stun combos as well as for some situational Max damage routes toxic wreath also known as bubble this move is performed using a quarter Circle back plus heavy punch input Aki hits twice using a poisonous bubble directly in front of her this move also poisons on hit and will knock the opponent down but it has no toxic Blossom effect this is Aki's safest special move to buffer from a cancelable normal as it's only minus four on block and leaves her far away enough that no four frame can actually punish this move is generally a useful option to end chain light strings particularly because it frame traps on block additionally this move can also be used to force a trade if it trades from Crouch light punch with a four-frame normal Aki actually gets a trade combo afterwards be careful though as this special is very vulnerable to drive impact while not particularly potent in grounded combos this special is extremely juggle friendly when landed against an Airborne opponent on a midscreen air connect this can reliably combo into either a drive Rush Crouch heavy punch for large Corner carry or link straight into level [Music] two on a cornered air connect this could be juggled into drive Rush down heavy kick which forms a key part of her corner combo routing and knock down Oki it's worth noting that although this move looks visually similar to some of Aki's projectile options this is actually entirely a strike attack and cannot be used to negate Fireballs serpent lash also known as Whip or chain this move can be performed by using a quarter Circle forward and punch input the different punches change the properties the light punch version causes Aki to send her chain directly forward extending about 2/3 of the screen on hit this inflicts poison and on block the move has variable Frame data depending on how far away you are it can be anything from - 6 to- 8 on block although if spaced it's very hard for most characters to ever punish the chain can also negate a projectile however doing so will prevent it from also hitting the opponent this move is fast and it covers a lot of distance and can generally be used to harass opponents in the mid-range the reward on regular hit is fairly low but it can chip away at your opponent's Drive gauge or poison them from a stray hit be careful though because this move is very vulnerable to both jump and drive impact if light punch flash connects on an already poisoned opponent it will activate toxic Blossom this sends the opponent into a very limited juggle state for most distances it is not possible to follow up after this juggle unless very close or in the corner if you're close enough to your opponent you can go into Crouch heavy punch level one or level three if light punch lash connects as a punish counter it actually causes the opponent to crumple if the opponent is not already poisoned the crumple on punish counter is very short you can't get any follow-ups from far away but up close you have enough time to drive rush into a light if the opponent is already poisoned then the crumple on punish counter is significantly longer and can almost always combo into drive Rush down heavy kick at the absolute tip it's sometimes necessary to substitute St heavy kick for either stand heavy Punch or Crouch heavy punch medium punch serpent lash when activated with medium punch this move changes to a diagonal upwards angle on hit this move launches the opponent far away and poisons them this move is very unsafe on block at minus 12 and additionally this move cannot hit crouching characters which is very important to keep in mind for her combo structure it's also the slowest of all three regular versions of serpent lash and will only combo from Heavies mediums and standing light kick medium serpent lash can also be used as a situational anti-air but it's very very slow usually usually it's only reserved for hard reads on someone jumping a fireball if the opponent is already poisoned this move will activate toxic Blossom causing the opponent to be put in a crumple State this crumple is one of Aki's most important combo tools and there are many follow-ups to choose from if the opponent is poisoned and Airborne the toxic Blossom effect will pop them up into the air allowing even further juggles heavy punch serpent lash when activated with heavy punch the chain attacks vertically upwards on hit this version launches the opponent and poisons them on Block it's very punishable it's also faster than medium Whip and this special will combo from any special cable normal heavy serpent lash is one of 's best anti-airs it has air invulnerability starting from frame four note however that the purely vertical hit box can make it whiff sometimes against empty jumps if the opponent is already poison this move will activate toxic Blossom launching them into a Juggle State on both ground and air connect this toxic Blossom effect can be combined with its anti-air properties to give Aki very strong juggle starters from an antiair it is also possible to juggle after this move even on a non-toxic Blossom anti-air but it has to hit very high up to do so Crouch heavy punch level one and level three are the most common follow-ups here OD serpent lash the OD version is activated by pressing a quarter Circle forward and any two punch buttons at the cost of two bars of Drive Aki sends a horizontal chain out in front of her similar to the light punch version the effect on hit is very different however Aki will pull herself in close to the opponent poison them and then be left Point Blank at plus4 Advantage this allows links into standing light kick and crouching light punch the relatively slow start up means that this will only combo from St heavy kick and crouching medium punch this move also has ex projectile durability this means it will blow straight through any nonex projectiles making it a useful fiable punish if it connects in this way it will also often be a punish counter allowing linkx in to St medium kick be aware though the startup is fairly slow so if you want to use it as a fireable punish it's more of a read than reaction if you try to reaction punish you're probably going to be too late additionally this move only has one hit of projectile durability against other ex fbls this means it'll lose outright to any two hit ex viable during the part of the animation where Aki pulls herself close to the opponent she is actually Invincible this can be used to avoid some attacks on air connect this move will still pull Aki in close poison the opponent allowing further juggles afterwards if the opponent is already poisoned this move will activate toxic Blossom and cause a crumple on hit similar to the medium punch whip effect notably this crumple state is significantly longer than the one on medium whip it's actually possible to combo into lights afterwards while keeping the opponent standing rather than forcing them into a Juggle state generally it's still preferred to juggle into Heavies so this doesn't provide that much of an advantage it's also possible to combo into a grounded throw from this crumple which can be used as a side switch option in the corner on an Airborne connect Against The Poisoned opponent the toxic Blossom effect here is very unique using it this way will completely reset the opponent's juggle State back to zero allowing anything to connect afterwards even normals this effect is very useful for certain Max damage juggle routes particularly after stuns this property of resetting the juggle State back to zero can also be used to set up some very sneaky resets I wouldn't Mo if I were you R fate also known as Flip or sometimes known as daggers this move is inputed by performing a quarter Circle back plus kick the different kick buttons have different effects this is the light version Aki will jump into the air and stab the opponent four times this travels about halfway across the screen Aki can also avoid projectiles while at the Apex of this move on hit this move leaves Aki Point Blank and with plus one advantage on Block it's safe at minus three it's only possible ble to get a combo afterwards on punish counter which does rarely happen notably this move becomes plus one when the opponent is in Burnout this gives Aki a good way to maintain pressure although there is a big gap when canceled into from normals when hitting an Airborne opponent this move will cause a very slight ground bounce effect although most specials will usually not be fast enough to combo afterwards you can still ccil straight into level three however uniquely among all versions of cruel fate the light kick version actually adds zero points to the juggle State this can be combined with the juggle State reset effect of toxic Blossom ex lash to allow a Juggle into stand light kick for advanced Mix-Ups as mentioned previously the final hit of this move can be celed into level three this can be useful for some juggle Enders and can also be used to protect against late Drive impacts medium kick cruel fate this version is executed with a quarter Circle back medium kick it's quite similar to the light kick version although slower on Startup but it travels slightly further it's also plus three on hit rather than plus one which means you can link afterwards on counter hit as well as punish counter medium kit cruel fate is probably the least useful version it travels a bit too far to be used in most burnout pressure strings and it lacks the combo utility of the heavy kick version occasionally you can tack it on the end of a juggle it also does slightly more damage than the light kick version heavy kick cruel fate this version is executed with a heavy kick input it travels nearly full screen although it is the slowest version of this move unlike the light and medium versions The Heavy kick version is actually plus4 on hit allowing links afterwards into stand light kick and Crouch light punch you can only combo into this from a punish counter stand heavy kick this is an extremely important punish counter combo route you can also use the heavy kick version of Cru fate as a viable punish due to the long range this gives a punish counter link into Stam medium kick uniquely the head heavy kick version of cruel fake does significantly more push back on block compared to the light kick and medium kick versions it's still minus three but Aki is placed outside of throw range making it harder for your opponent to mix you up afterwards the downside of this effect is that the increased push back also applies in Burnout making it significantly worse as a pressure tool than the light and medium kick versions on air connect this move puts the opponent into a ground bounce like the light and medium versions however the heavy versions ground bounce is significantly higher than the other two and you can always get a Juggle afterwards into level one this makes it a good way to end juggle combos if you don't want to spend three bars if the heavy kick version of cruel fate hits extremely high in a Juggle you actually have enough time to juggle into light and heavy Lash if any of the four hits drop this will not work OD cruel fate this version is executed using any two kick buttons by holding forward or back once Aki leaves the ground you can actually steer the flip to change her trajectory on Grounded hit this move initiates a cinematic followup poisons the opponent and leaves them in a hard knockdown State on block this move is plus two making it very useful for continuing pressure on an air hit this move will not activate the Cinematic followup and will instead put the opponent into a very high ground bounce while also still poisoning them this ground boun is very juggle friendly and forms a core part of some of her juggle routes it's worth mentioning that the Cinematic followup on the grounded version will only activate if either the first or second hit connects if only the third or fourth hit connects you do not get the Cinematic followup and you can actually poison the opponent and even continue a combo if you punish counter this can actually happen quite often against Fireballs okay snake step also known as slide starting out with light snake step this is performed with a quarter Circle forward plus light kick input Aki lunges forward but then dashes backwards Aki becomes projectile invulnerable from frame eight all the way until the end of recovery it's worth mentioning that because she's projectile Invincible all the way until the end of recovery even if you wake up back into the fireball you can't actually get hit by it you can always block from frame 14 until the end of recovery Aki has a very low profile htbx you can use this to avoid drive impact and certain reversals the primary usage of this move is to allow Aki to reposition herself backwards while also baiting out certain options from your opponent such as ex DPS and drive impact you can also use this repositioning effect to go back to Aki's ideal anti-air range think of it mostly like a back dash that you can cancel into from normals medium snakes de this version is performed with a quarter Circle forward plus medium kick input Aki slides forward covering a little more than half screen distance but note that she cannot pass through her opponent even from point blank as with the light kick version she gains projectile inv vulnerability and a low profile hurt box during the middle of the slide unfortunately due to being relatively slow and very vulnerable during recovery this move is almost never used to directly approach the opponent in neutral the main utility of medium snake step is as a way to close in on opponents after certain knockdowns in order to get Oki heavy kick snake deep this version is performed with a quarter Circle forward plus heavy kick functionally this is very similar to the medium kick version except Aki travels even further but it's even slower like the medium kick version this is mostly used after knockdowns to cover ground quickly and get Oki unlike the medium kick version however the heavy kick version can side switch this can make it a very situational option while Aki is burned out in order to escape the corner OD snake step this version is performed using any two kick buttons Aki slides forward with a very similar trajectory to the heavy kick version unlike the heavy kick version however the OD version is fully strike and projectile invulnerable from the very first frame making it a decent Escape option to get out of pressure use it carefully though as this move has no throw throw inv vulnerability and being thrown out of it will be a force punish counter causing you to instantly lose three bars of drive on top of the throw damage ption the recovery for this move is very unique if Aki side switches through the opponent and gets to the other side she will remain strike and projectile invulnerable all the way through until the end of recovery however if she does not pass through the opponent and instead stays on the same side she does have hitable recovery this effect is presumably to weaken its utility as a full screen fi counter as mentioned previously this move can be canceled into from Aki's Fireballs doing this can protect you from common fireable punishes you can also use this to trick your opponents into meeting your fi with their own only to slide in and punish okay let's talk about Aki's supers starting with her level one deadly implication in my master this one's performed with a Double Quarter circle plus kick inut and costs one bar of super meter Aki kicks the opponent into the air activating a cinematic where she traps them in a bubble and detonates it this super also poisons the opponent this super is strike and throw invulnerable from the first frame making it one of Aki's best wake up reversal options be aware though that this super has 10 frames of start up which means it's actually possible for some characters to mey a jab and still recover in time to block oh dear on hit this super Does 1,800 damage which makes it one of the lowest damaging level ones when hitting raw however poison damage inflicted before the Super will continue to tick during the entire long slow animation in my master keep in mind also that due to the fact that poison damage is not subject to combo scaling this is actually one of the highest damage level ones if used at the end of a long combo provided the opponent is already poisoned in my master the long horizontal range of this super also makes it a good punish tool particularly against some characters max range sweeps in the corner this super also gives a surprisingly good Oki situation afterwards a fireable done immediately afterwards cannot be jumped making it particularly good against opponents in Burnout in my master level two tainted Talons this one's performed with a Double Quarter Circle back plus punch input Aki attacks with a barrage of poison lashes these lashes have projectile hit boxes and will neutralize both regular and ex fables the angle and distance of the super is determined by the punch button you press light punch attacks Point Blank medium punch covers a range from about half screen all the way to full screen and heavy punch all the hits will go full screen every hit of the level two will also inflict poison existing poison damage will take during this super but the animation is so fast that it doesn't make a noteworthy difference to her overall damage unlike her level one this level two technically starts up in seven frames however the first active frame is way above Aki's head the chains will not actually reach a grounded opponent until around frame 14 this makes it a lot slower than the Frame data numbers would suggest a lot of common punishes that you'd expect to work don't work I unlike most level twos this super has no invulnerability whatsoever and you cannot use it as a reversal it can however be used as a fireable punish but will only work if the chains are able to wipe out the incoming projectile if you miss the incoming projectile Aki will get hit out of the animation losing out on most of the damage and two bars of super so you definitely don't want this to happen because of this the medium punch version is actually a better projectile punish than the heavy punch version since the heavy punch version usually misses the incoming Fireball this is the medium punch version and this is the heavy punch version the final hit of this super will spawn a very large pool of poison on the floor it's over this pool is similar to the one created by Orchid spring however it's significantly larger and uniquely this pool will not disappear if Aki gets hit strangely the medium and heavy versions of this super also cause the poison pool to very slowly creep forward I don't know why the light punch version doesn't do this and I don't know any real use for this property but it's worth mentioning that it exists it's over this super also does good chip damage on block and is somewhat safer than most level twos at minus 19 this makes it a very good and relatively safe full screen chip out option against opponent in Burnout be aware though that there are character specific ways to evade and punish this super even from full screen the most common way to avoid it is any character that can change their air momentum level three also known as claws of Yazi still here there then here and there my Magnum open this is performed with a Double Quarter Circle forward and punch input and cost three bars Aki lunges forward to initiate the level three cinematic it travels about half screen as with most level 3es this is fully invulnerable from frames 1 to 12 making it a very good reversal orbe it at a very high meter cost only use if you're certain it's going to hit the super itself is fairly standard like most level 3es it does 4,000 damage on hit going up to 4,500 if Aki is below the 25% Health required for critical art Aki can get Oki after both the regular level three and the critical art version by using a drive Rush it's worth noting that the critical art is actually less advantageous than the regular level three generally you want to follow regular level three with Drive Rush forward heavy kick and critical up with Drive Rush St medium punch as mentioned previously this cinematic freezes the timer completely poison damage will not tick at during the level three animation and therefore poisoning the opponent beforehand provides no additional benefit to this super okay let's talk combos before we get into the combos though I want to stress that Street Fighter 6's combo system has a ton of Freedom so I don't like to label any combo as optimal Aki has a huge number of variables to choose from when picking combo routing including drive gauge cost super meter cost regular hit counter hit uh punish counter okis after the combo screen positioning Corner carry whether the opponent is poisoned or not before the combo starts and whether or not to poison them at the end of the combo the following is a list of common bnbs that cover a lot of these conditions but I want to stress that this is not an exhaustive list of every combo ever but I feel like it gives you the building blocks of her common roots to give you an idea of how it all fits together I'm going to include combo notation on the screen for these but there will also be a full list of notated combos in the attached document e my master got you F in my master got you e got you got F in my Masterwork got still now got you okay let's talk about Corner combos real quick uh you may have noticed that all of the combos previously were midscreen combos the reason that I didn't include Corner combos for Aki is that corner combos almost always use the same Enders so generally speaking you want to do the same combo as the midscreen route however the combo route diverges once you land either toxic Blossom medium lash or toxic Blossom heavy lash these combos will be notated from the point that the medium lash connects the combo that you use beforehand doesn't particularly matter as long as you end in medium punch Lash the corner combos ending in toxic Blossom heavy lash you do the exact same combo as the medium lash routes except you omit the St heavy kick at the beginning refer to the medium lash combo for more details all right up next let's cover some anti-air combos these include opponents being unpoisoned and poisoned got got you got you k got you got you in my master okay let's move on to stun combos so after stunning an opponent in Burnout with a drive impact Aki has some very strong and unique stun combos by taking advantage of the fact that she can set an orchid spring underneath the opponent before beginning the combo in my master will HT in my master in my master here there then here and my Magnum open in my master will F in my master this will hurt in my master got now here there then here and there my Magnum open okay let's quickly talk about Advanced Micro walk combos by walking forward for a few frames in the middle of a combo it's possible to restore a tiny amount of Drive Gauge by doing this you can perform three Drive Rush cancels in a single combo rather than the usual limit of two this is mostly for advanced play only and only increases damage output by a very small amount I would not recommend these combos for beginners Aki generally has two micro walks that you may see in real matches uh I've classified them as the easier microw walk and the hard microw walk the easier microw walk up first is Drive Rush St medium kick walk forward for a few frames and then St medium punch here's an example combo you'll know you've done this microw walk correctly if after the drive rush you still have a pixel of Drive gauge if you burn out after the second Drive Rush you've missed the timing this microw walk is moderately lenient and I think it's reasonably match viable I go for this sometimes in matches so uh it's it's definitely more doable the harder microw walk is this one you do a drive Rush St heavy kick walk forward and then link into St medium punch got you here's an example of that in a real combo the hard micro walk does fractionally more damage than the easier one but the walk forward is frame perfect in this one and I generally don't advise this for match safety use this one for style points but I wouldn't bring it into tournaments okay now that we've talked about Aki's combos it's also now very important that we cover Aki's Oki once you finish your combo you need to know where to go next we're going to start with a thing called the plus 44 knockdown which I've covered in quite a few of the combo routes many of Aki's common combo Enders leave her at plus 44 knockdown Advantage this is an extremely important knockdown state to aim for since it leads to a wide variety of powerful Oki options here are some examples of common plus 44 knockdown starters being plus 44 gives Aki access to an immediate safe jump this safe jump is immune to the vast majority of anti-air reversals there are a small number of exceptions though Lily's wind clad light and ex DP and armored reversals such as Honda OD headbut and Marissa OD scutum can get through it note however that you can still safe jump the armored reversals I just mentioned if you switch from a jumping heavy attack to a jumping light attack this safe jump requires a lot of practice to take advantage of however you have to modify your air normal depending on whether your opponent recovers in place or they back roll generally if your opponent recovers in place you'll need to Safe jump with a cross up down heavy punch if they back roll you can save jump with any other normal although jump heavy punch and jump heavy kick are usually the preferred options I would recommend in investing a lot of time into practicing reacting to both of these recoveries you can set a dummy in training mode to random recovery and then see if you can see both sides thankfully in the corner you never need to react to your opponent's recovery type as it doesn't matter if they quick rise or back roll some plus 44 knockdowns have been specially engineered to leave the opponent at a slightly further distance these ones do not require you to adjust your safe jump for your opponent's recovery making them much safer in matches if you're struggling to react to your opponent's wake up type here's a couple of examples now plus 44 Oki isn't just for safe jumps it also has some other very strong options you can Double Dash which will leave you plus six point blank on both recoveries after this you have several options you can either throw although this must be delayed slightly you can do a meaty Crouch light kick which will link into stand light kick you can go for a Crouch medium kick into a link which will also be Plus on block you can also do a standing heavy kick which will beat your opponent's wake up buttons and give you a big combo afterwards you can also neutral jump this is generally a hard read to beat your opponent trying to delay Tech you can also substitute this double dash for a medium kick snake step this will leave you plus five rather than plus six being plus five is better in some ways you don't need to delay at all to land a throw here however me medium kick snake step does not have as much horizontal travel as a Double Dash as a result on certain knockdowns you can find yourself too far away to connect with proper links afterwards this is particularly noticeable if the opponent back rolls after a plus 44 knockdown you can also set up a meaty overhead this can be done against a cornered opponent or a midscreen opponent that chooses to Quick rise close to you to perform this you can simply Dash after the knockdown and then do overhead this overhead is plus five on a regular hit which allows you to link into lights afterwards take advantage of the fact that the opponent is likely also poisoned another good option after the plus 44 knockdown is to do a drive Rush doing an extended Drive Rush here is a powerful ok option since you can cancel the late frames of Drive rush into block this allows you to either go for Drive Rush enhanced normals or bait reversals by canceling the drive rush into a block here are some examples you can do a drive Rush forward heavy kick which is plus six on block and plus eight on hit you can also do a drive Rush crouching medium kick which is plus five on block and plus n on hit this is also especially good because it's a low you can do a drive Rush down forward medium punch which is an overhead that's plus two on block and plus seven on hit you can also Drive Rush directly into a meaty throw which will beat your opponent blocking or punish counter them if they wake up with Parry got you my my my finally you can cancel out of the drive rush into back walk this will bait out reversals and also shimmy if the opponent attempts a delayed throw Tech okay that's enough about the plus 44 knockdown let's talk about another key element of Aki's Oki game toxic Blossom venomous Fang most corner combo can be ended with this move which gives an extremely advantageous tumbling knockdown this knockdown is plus 84 and gives you plenty of time to set up lots of different situations you can perform an orchid spring after this knockdown which will poison your opponent the moment they wake up and this still leaves Aki at plus 38 advantage to go for further pressure here are some examples after placing the puddle you can whiff stand heavy punch to set up a tick throw you can also whiff a St medium punch to time yourself for a forward heavy kick mey if you whiffer stand light punch here it also sets you up for a meaty overhead this is plus five on hit and zero on block another good option after placing the Orchid spring is Dash into a drive Rush Crouch medium kick this is a mey low that's plus 11 on hit and plus seven on block finally you can follow up the Orchid spring with an instant Fireball this Fireball a hit mey is+ 17 on hit plus 12 12 on block and will also protect you against wake up level ones and certain reversals know that these Corner options are particularly powerful because they can almost all be used to loop back into the same situation me if you choose not to place the Orchid spring after the venomous Fang knockdown you can instead whiff a Crouch heavy punch this will convert the existing knockdown into a plus 44 knockdown which enables any of the previous Oki options another powerful Oki option after toxic Blossom venomous Fang is performing a light snake step into a fireball and then a drive Rush the fireball hits extremely meaty which gives you very large advantage on hit and on block this setup also has a built-in defensive option select the drive Rush causes you to transition through Parry for a small number of frames before you start moving you will automatically Parry any fast invulnerable reversals your opponent does such as odps keep in mind that this effect will automatically happen without any extra inputs on your part making it very very safe note however that this will not work against slower reversals since you'll be too far into the drive Rush start up to automatically Parry eddp is a good example finally I'm going to show off some assorted Oki options from other common knockdown situations let's start with forward throw after a forward throw you can perform a drive Rush standing medium kick this leaves you far away if the opponent back rolls but because it hits mey you can always link into a stand heavy punch you can also perform a drive Rush St medium punch this will leave you close than St medium kick for better pressure but you have to manually time it it will whiff if you do it instantly after a back throw you can do a drive rushing to afford heavy kick this is manually timed but it leaves you point blank and very Plus on both recoveries if you back throw your opponent directly into the corner you can do a reg regular Dash and still be plus eight up next we're going to cover some fiable trap knockdowns several knockdowns that Aki has can only give Oki with a drive Rush here are some common examples rather than going for a typical Drive Rush here you can also opt to throw a fireball first and then drive Rush behind it got although this fball is not a true mey it does create a very nasty trap where your opponent will either have to defend against the fireball or jump over it if they jump the fireball you can actually anti-air on reaction with the drive Rush stand heavy kick and this can lead to some very stylish combos okay so we've talked a little bit about Aki's Oki game let's talk a little bit about the reverse let's talk about Aki's defense Aki overall has some of the weaker defensive options in the game but they must all be utilized to avoid getting molded once your opponent knocks you down here's a brief list of Aki's main defensive options besides just regular blocking perfect Parry which will beat strikes and projectiles delayed throw Tech which will counter throws and will protect you against meaty buttons wake up Drive reversal which will beat throws and mey normals with large recovery block and Parry Drive reversal will beat Drive Rush cancels and moves with a lot of recovery board jump is also a good option for Aki it evades throws and shimmies and because of how sharply her jump down heavy punch can cross up it will still hit some throw recovery keep in mind though that this is still vulnerable to cross cut DPS and the opponent walking under your jump back dash is another good defensive option it will beat throws and can often follow up with a punish counter Crouch light punch especially in the corner Crouch light punch is also a good button to interrupt with it'll beat fake pressure strings or M time mees standing medium punch is also a good interrupt button surprisingly it will beat spacing traps that would normally cause crouching light punch to whiff particularly after the opponent has used multiple lights to space themselves out as mentioned earlier OD snake step is also a good option keep in mind that this will lose to throws finally you can also use your level one and level three supers all of these defensive options have a very limited set of counters make sure you rotate them in a way that's unpredictable and try not to overuse any singular option too much okay let's talk about burnout pressure next one of Aki's most interesting aspects is her wide range of strong burnout pressure Loops these are sequences of moves where the opponent cannot interrupt while in Burnout unless they have access to an invincible super sometimes these can even be used to create Checkmate scenarios let's start with Crouch light punch into standing medium Punch If you Loop these two normals repeatedly it creates a frame trap that also drags the opponent towards the corner this Loop cannot be interrupted by anything except Invincible supers Marissa's Tim and JP's Amnesia note that each successive Loop pushes you further away from the opponent you'll usually be too far away to continue after around three or four reps if you have plenty of Drive gauge to spare you can wait until you're just about to push yourself too far out and then do Stam medium punch Drive Rush cancel into another Stam medium punch then do a third Stam medium punch and and then restart the loop this sequence can be repeated multiple times although be careful not to burn yourself out or let the opponent Escape burnout once you reach the corner you have several different options to attempt to stun your opponent you can attempt St medium punch straight into a DI this is the simplest and most straightforward option although there is a fairly large gap between medium punch and drive impact high level opponents can punish you with a throw before the DI hits another option is to do Crouch light punch and then rather than doing a St medium punch you swap it for stand heavy kick into Di by switching St medium punch for St heavy kick the Gap into the DI becomes so small that the opponent cannot Escape without an invincible reversal however do keep in mind that Crouch light punch into stand heavy kick is not a true frame trap the opponent can interrupt before you get a chance to attempt the DI given that the previous two options both have holes that allow the opponent to interrupt this final option is much safer than the other two but significantly more expensive you can do stand medium punch Drive Rush cancel Crouch medium punch and then cancel into di this is significantly more costly to your drive gauge than the previous two it requires four bars of drive to perform rather than one however in exchange every part of this sequence is uninterruptible without an invincible reversal this is very useful for checkmate scenarios the gap between Drive Rush Crouch medium punch and drive impact is so small in fact that even JP cannot interrupt with amnesia another variant of the burnout pressure Loop is to integrate a coward Crouch roll into each rep this sequence is also a looping frame trap however if the opponent attempts to interrupt between stand medium punch and roll they'll trade Aki can actually combo off this trade because of this trade it's less safe than the Crouch light punch sing medium punch Loop but in exchange you will also deal a small amount of Chip damage to the opponent with each rep this is because the roll counts as a special move this can be useful to get a tiny bit of damage before stunning the opponent it may be the difference between the stun combo killing and leaving the opponent still alive another good burnout option is light and medium cruel fate as mentioned previously cruel fate also becomes Plus in Burnout this can be used as a way to bring yourself back to the point blank position meterless this allows you to restart a loop once you push yourself too far away however keep in mind that this is a risky option as there's a large gap between any normal and cruel fake connecting and can be interrupted so use with caution interestingly cruel fate can also completely avoid many common wakeup supers this makes it useful in Burnout pressure strings both for resuming a loop and also baiting out lots of common level ones level twos and level 3es I'll include a list on screen of all the supers I've found that this can beat keep in mind that when this interaction occurs you also get a punish counter on light cruel fate this is the rare scenario where you can actually combo afterwards finally I'm going to go over some matchup notes for each character these are character specific interactions that I feel are important or worth mentioning but I don't think these should be seen as a full matchup guide if I made a full guide for every matchup in the game this video would be 15 hours long which I'm trying to avoid so I'm just going to focus on a few key points for each character you can reliably beat Luke's sandblast with venomous Fang make sure to punish uncharged heavy punch flash knuckle with Crouch light punch Luke has very strong jumping normals that Luke players like to press early in the jump Ark this makes Crouch heavy kick significantly more like to punish counter than in most other matchups be ready to pick up a combo if this happens take advantage of Aki's extremely good drive rush to prevent Jamie from drinking Jamie players often like to try and get a drink in before a fireball reaches them you can bait this out by canceling it to OD snake step to close the gap at medium distance you can punish Jam's Sweep with stand heavy kick and even at Absolute max range you can always get a punish with Crouch heavy punch Jam's first record is minus 6 on block this allows punishes with Stam medium punch if it's poorly spaced be aware though that you will open yourself up for a spacing trap if they wreck her from further away manon's overhead spin kick is minus 9 on block punish it with st heavy kick if spaced poorly or St medium kick if a little further away at max range Aki cannot punish this on block be aware of manon's jump approach she can threaten a jump in from significantly further away than most characters but Crouch heavy kick will consistently antiair at this distance manon's level two is extremely unsafe on block take advantage of this recovery by back dashing twice and then place an orchid spring against kimbery St heavy kick will intercept both teleports if you react correctly you'll also get a full combo regardless of which version is used so press heavy kick as soon as you see any puff of smoke then use the screen shake to choose which combo to go for you can punish Kimble's light shoulder with a Crouch light punch make sure to punish blocked run slide with Heavies up close and lights at long range almost all of Kimble's run cancels are interruptible if you see a kimbery player cancel any normal into her regular command run other than crouching heavy punch you can always interrupt with a jab many of Marissa's common moves to throw in neutral can be low profiled by going into coward Crouch this can be used to evade and punish Superman punch step kick and Gladius don't overuse this however as Marissa can punish you severely if she predict to your enter stance Marissa's Gladius has a very large extended hurt box on whiff wait until she's finished charging and then respond with Stan heavy kick as mentioned previously OD scutum can't be safe jumped using jumping heavy normals however if you switch to a jumping light attack you can block in time which will give you a plus three situation and take two bars of drive from the Marissa player note that crouching medium kick and crouching heavy kick are very useful pokes in this matchup they both hit low enough to ignore the armor on OD Gladius you can also single hit confirm them into Super take advantage of Aki's extremely fast Drive rush to close the gap if Lily attempts to charge wind stocks from distance be careful though because if she holds the heavy spin she can release it on reaction to punish Drive Rush this can be mitigated by throwing a FAL beforehand you you can also cancel out of your drive rush into light serpent lash this will end your forward momentum and it might even give you a combo on punish counter once Lily has wind charges she can easily punish Fireballs using OD Condor Spire using Fireballs is ill advised once she's got stocks you can low profile underneath OD Condor Spire using either cow Crouch or light snake step fire it's even possible to transition from coward Crouch into a roll just as Lily is about to pass over you in order to get a punish the timing is quite strict though Lily's level two and three both have gigantic recovery on block and after a neutral jump both can lead to an orchid spring combo be careful attempting a safe jump if Lily has wind stocks high level players will punish you with wake up windcloud light or OD DP this can be baited but you have to do an empty jump JP's standing heavy punch has a large heart box around his feet on whiff it can be tempting to try to punish with standing normals the crouching heavy punch is significantly more consistent JP has no reliable defensive options against mey projectiles this can be particularly exploited in the corner as it will be OD Amnesia as well as all three of his supers although Aki's level one is not projectile invulnerable on Startup she becomes fully Invincible the moment that the first hit connects and this initiates the Cinematic followup you can take advantage of this cinematic invulnerability to avoid Amnesia bombs my Aki's jumping heavy punch can be surprisingly difficult for JP to consistently anti-air it will often trade with JP's Crouch heavy punch which may sometimes be a trade worth fishing for if you have the life lead perfect Parry into a drive Rush can be very useful to get through JP's projectiles against his ground Spike you can get a punish counter Drive Rush stand heavy kick from the mid-range you can even do a drive Rush Crouch heavy punch out of perfect Parry from almost full screen you can also use this against his horizontal Fireballs including the first hit of the OD version it doesn't always lead to a punish but you can still utilize the drive rush to get frame advantage on block JP is very unique because his regular Amnesia is active on frame two this makes him one of the only characters in the game able to easily counter Aki's burnout pressure while you should still be proactive against a burned out JP you can't really utilize most of Aki's burnout Loops you can punish JP's down forward heavy punch with Aki's Crouch heavy punch this works at most ranges however be aware that at the absolute tip it can't be punished light serpent lash can pass over jury's Fireball while this trade does slightly more damage to Aki than it does to jury it's often still worth going for you get a hard knockdown and you also manage to take away one of jury's stocks OD serpent lash will also pass over the fireball however instead of trading with it you can get a full combo jury's medium kick fuar store is minus six on block and at most ranges Aki can punish with a Stam medium punch be aware that jury can be safe but it has to be at the absolute tip jury's dive kick can often make akis antiair whiff generally the better option here is just to block the dive kick and punish jury's dive kick is almost never safe on block you can punish DJ's medium punch heavy punch and ex fbl with Venom Fang be careful though since he can faint with light Fireball try to react to the projectile actually appearing rather than just going for a guess if you aren't sure if he's going to faint or not then just cancel out of the stance you can punish DJ's medium kick soat with st medium punch but only if it's poorly spaced DJ's knee shot forces him into a punished counter State on anti-air you can take advantage of this using St heavy kick for a guaranteed juggle afterwards DJ is one of only three characters in the game without an invulnerable level one if he enters burnout while below two bars of super you can absolutely mle him has many different ways of approaching from the air that can be difficult to stop heavy punch lash is your most consistent grounded option it has to be performed early against low dive kicks jump back medium kick is an extremely good antiair in this matchup it will consistently beat dive kicks and due to the force punish counter c will be knocked down you can drive rush back in for pressure after this situation even on a back jump Camy players will often attempt to bypass Fireballs using spin knuckle try to intercept it with either Crouch light Punch or Stam medium punch many of cami's hooligan Mix-Ups can be stuffed with a jab this will also put Camy into a forc knockdown state which allows further juggles be very careful using Fireballs once Camy has three bars of super her level three is extremely fast and punish even from full screen if you did throw a fireable during the Super Flash it's always worth trying to cancel into ex snake step it doesn't always work but if it does it might save you keep in mind that if you pull off this Escape you don't get any punish afterwards you can reliably punish reuse Fireballs using venomous Fang Aki Stam medium kick is very good in neutral in this matchup it will beat a lot of common Ryu pokes and you can usually link afterwards you can punish a blocked sweep using Crouch heavy kick this works at nearly every range and leads to a juggle with Drive Rush the absolute tip of reuse sweep you need to switch to stand heavy punch instead against Honda try to perfect Parry both headbutt and butt Slam attemp against headbut specifically you can attempt a perfect parry and then double tap forward afterwards this will transition into a drive Rush In Case Honda stops early with light headbutt heavy punch lash will consistently anti-air butt slam but only if Honda stays in front of you the Lash will often hit very high up in the air this usually leads into a Juggle even without toxic Blossom you can also use St heavy kick which will lead to a Juggle afterwards be aware that if Honda passes behind you then both heavy lash and St heavy kick will lose you will likely get punished counted at this angle your most consistent anti-air is to air to a jump medium punch is a good example as mentioned previously you can't save jump Honda using jumping Heavies by switching to Jumping lights you can protect yourself against wake up EX headbut Honda's level two is a projectile punish however it can easily be baited and avoided by throwing fbls and then canceling into ex snake step after the flash H players like to use neutral jump heavy punch to steer themselves over Fireballs without risking a forward jump you can punish this with a drive rush into stand heavy kick you can punish all versions of blanca Ball by doing a drive impact the moment before Blanka makes contact the timing is quite strict though and you'll be left open for a large punish if you fail perfect Parry is the safer but less rewarding option when pressuring blaner a delayed St heavy Ki is a good option since it will cover both wake up OD up ball and wake up OD air ball be very cautious throwing Fireballs against Blanca he can easily punish them on reaction with down forward heavy punch Blanca's forward heavy punch is safe at max range but can be punished with Crouch heavy Punch If not spaced correctly lancer's down forward heavy punch is different to a lot of sliding sweeps even at the absolute tip is still extremely punishable on block standing heavy kick will consistently punish even the L active frames you can antiair his rainbow roll with st heavy kick for a free juggle against guile venomous Fang can punish booms however the window is very small so you have to react very early gu's medium kick soat is minus 6 on block you can punish it with st medium Punch If not correctly spaced Di's heavy kick upside down kick is minus 8 on block you can punish it with Crouch medium punch up close or stand medium kick from slightly further out Aki can reliably punish Sonic Blade with Crouch heavy kick and Crouch heavy punch even from distance do not let G players set this up carelessly it can look like the projectile is blocking you from hitting him but he has a very large hurt box during this move you can also Drive Rush beforehand if they attempt to set it up from full screen Guile's Crouch medium kick to forward medium punch Target combo can be punished in several ways either interrupt in the Middle with stand light kick or punish the overhead on block with another stand light kick keep in mind though that the overhead is safe if it's spaced out Guile's OD flash kick can be baited out on block by using a max range stand heavy kit canceled into light snake step this is a very useful tool since every other special cancel that Aki can perform from St heavy kick loses to this you can punish a poorly spaced run heavy kick from Ken with either Crouch light Punch or stand light kick you can also venomous Fang through Ken's Fireballs this punishes very consistent and more lenient than most due to Ken's below average fiall recovery you can punish Ken's heavy kick Dragon lash with either perfect Parry an early Drive Impact or a stand jab interrupt CH Le's medium kick hansu is a common move for for Chun players to throw out it punishes fireballs and it's also safe on block you can try to interrupt it in the air with a Stam medium punch buffered into coward Crouch roll this covers for both a grounded hit and an air hit you can also perfect Parry The Landing ex hantu is also commonly neutral it's a better fireable punish than her other versions this version's minus five on block so you can punish with Crouch light punch up close from max range you can only punish with Crouch light kick into a Crouch medium kick this can be super cancelled though if a Chun Le player attempts to escape the corner using a wall jump she'll be forced into a Juggle state by any anti-air normal stand heavy kick will give you a big juggle Chun Le can go into her lowprofile stance to avoid incoming Fireballs this makes it difficult to drive Rush behind Fireballs since she can cancel into the medium punch followup you can bait this out by canceling your drive Rush momentum into a light punch lash for a punish counter you can punish zangi Sweep with Crouch heavy kick at most ranges at the absolute tip you have to use Crouch heavy punch this move is never safe against daki if you ever block zang's larer a drive impact will always punish the remaining spins zang's forward heavy kick overhead is minus 9 at worst you can punish it with st heavy kick if it's performed Too Close although be aware it's often safe if spaced properly Aki's Crouch heavy kick is a very good normal in this matchup it will counter a lot of ge's common pokes most notably it will cleanly stuff his armored standing heavy punch gef is another character with no good reversal level one if you get him into burnout and he has less than two bars you can bully him note that his level one is invincible but if he uses it to try and escape a sequence you can just punish on the other side I am com for you zangief's level two is extremely slow on start up if a GE player attempts to punish your fiall with it you can almost always cancel into ex snake step you then have enough time left over while gef is stuck spinning to set up an orchid spring ready dson players like to float a lot in neutral in order to avoid incoming Fireballs you can snipe him out of the sky with venomous Fang at low Heights at higher Heights medium punch lash also works you can often even juggle after both of these interactions if you see dalim attempt an instant air teleport you can just press stand live punch if he teleports in you'll get a full juggle if he teleports away you're at no risk if Dum is floating high above you then antia with stand heavy kick for a full juggle D's longrange normals can be whiff punished on reaction St heavy kick buffered into a drive Rush can pick up combos even from full screen keep in mind that dum has very weak wake up options his level one is not invincible and his level two cannot hit crouching characters a mey Crouch medium kick is a very good option in this matchup if Dum does wake up with his level two especially in the corner wait until he releases it into the air the easiest punish is a throw you are a naive one if the opponent is already poisoned you can actually utilize the invulnerability on OD lash to evade the level two and continue the combo rasheed's Fireballs are very easy to punish with venomous Fang you can punish rashed's stand heavy kick with a stand light kick if not spaced correctly if Rashid tries to give himself plus frames using heavy punch Cyclone you can interrupt with Stam medium punch and then confirm into another light attack if Rashid attempts to ro activate his level two Aki can actually punish it with her own level two even from full screen don't try to manually time your level two here after the Super Flash you can take advantage of Street Fighter 6's buffer system by inputting a Double Quarter Circle back during rasheed's super animation and then holding down punch this gives you a 100% consistent reversal timing be aware that Rasheed can make this level two activation safe either by getting a knockdown or putting you in Block St with ex viable you can also completely pass through rashid's two using either OD snake step or venomous Fang but note that both these options are very punishable if baited out greatt you greatt if you're already in Coward Crouch stance before Rasheed activates the super venomous Fang is actually a guaranteed punish even from full screen if Rasheed attempts to fly around the screen or escape the corner using Arabian Sky High wait until the double jump is fully completed and then antio is stand heavy kick if he's too far away you can also use medium punch serpent lash or chase him down with a drive Rush Rasheed players sometimes like to knock you down with medum medum kick Eagle Spike and then fully charge a fireball for Oki you can actually punish this easily by waking up with forward jump heavy punch in the mirror match Aki can punish her own Fireball very easily with venomous Fang be aware though that the opposing Aki can escape using OD snake step it's still worth going for because you'll drain two bars of drve from your opponent I've already covered most aspects of Aki's kit in the main body of this guide so I'm going to treat the rest of the guide as kind of the anti- AI guide refer to that for punishes and counters Ed's light punch Blitz is minus five on block you can punish it from all ranges with stand light kick Ed players like to use charge flicker in this matchup it will interrupt you if you go for a fireball into drive Rush approach got you can counter punish this hard by doing Fireball into venomous Fang or OD snake step Ed's jumping medium kick allows him to threaten a jump in from very far angles as well as neutral jump from midscreen Aki's Crouch heavy kick will anti-air this very consistently Ed's OD uppercut is much slower on Startup than most Invincible reversals a mey Crouch light punch will still still give you plenty of time to block and punish his level one super is also slow usually it can't punish Jabs wake up Drive reversal is very useful against Ed's charged flicker Oki as it will still reach after Ed's forward throw in the corner don't overuse this though since Ed can bait it by canceling into a back dash this requires a hard read on his part though you can punish akuma's viable with venomous Fang the second hit of Akuma stand heavy kick whiffs on crouches you can wait until it passes over your head and then punish with Crouch medium kick akuma's air fireable is tricky to stop from ranges Crouch heavy kick is your most consistent option from further out you can respond with a forward jump of your own Drive Impact OD lash or venomous Fang keep in mind though that these options all lose to regular jumps only use them if your certain air fiable is coming if you're unsure what air option Akuma is going to use the safest option is generally just a back dash you can reliably punish demon flip with st heavy kick this leads to a full juggle if you made it this far into the guide we're at the end now um I just like to thank everyone who uh has been supporting my stream and my YouTube lately if you've got any questions that you feel were not covered by the guide you can always drop into the stream and ask I try and help where I can and uh yeah I
