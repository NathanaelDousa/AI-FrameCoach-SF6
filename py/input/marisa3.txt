howdy howdy howdy back at it again today's video going to go over Mariza's season 3 knockdowns in Oki uh we're going to go through light demo medium dema heavy demo as much as I can cover we're going to do it today we're going to look at auto time manually timed corner midcreen all that fun stuff without further ado let's get into the video so I want to start off with light dema this leaves us at plus 31 and we have a couple different auto timed options the thing that I like is this drive rush into charged heavy punch so this will in fact beat mashing let's show that have him wake up with jab here and then we can combo into back heavy punch into whatever extension or ender we would like it will also catch jump out and we can still combo into back heavy punch so catches mashing catches jump what happens if they block well then we're plus eight okay so what do you do with that plus eight well a couple different things so first things first we can just do a slight walk up into a throw which is good obviously gets them to attack makes them want to do something you can frame trap with stand minion kick stand light kick into light dema that used to be a little consistent but they reduced the push back on her stand light kick so this is more consistent as a uh combo now so I think this is a better option than it used to be you can also if you want to leave no gaps you just go into back heavy punch into like Gladius keep it as a block string deals almost two bars of drive gauge damage sets up a spacing trap you're in business if you know they're going to sit still you can command grab but you have to be careful because characters that have fast walk speeds can walk out of it some characters can't uh leave that up to your own testing at this point in time okay so that's it for this option what are the weaknesses of this uh well the main one of course is just that it's susceptible to wake up perfect parry because it is in fact safe to drive impact right not that bad safe to the eye beats jump beats mash we showed that so main thing there is it's just kind of weak to parry so you're like "Okay what are my options to beat parry?" And there's a couple things so first thing is we can manually time a command grab right so then if they try to wake up with drive parry boom punish counter uh punish counter thrown we're in a good spot right what other options do we have other than charge stand heavy punch and command grab okay we can do drive rush into overhead that ends up being plus one on block so we get a little bit of a 50/50 between crouch jab and throw okay and again this overhead is done just immediately the important thing to realize though is that this throw will lose to them mashing you will get counter hit which is why we need to be able to establish that we're going to do the strike option first okay so the other thing that's kind of a newly good option this season is going to be drive rush into crouch medium kick you do have to manually time this the visual cue that I'm using right now is she takes this one big step you see like she puts her right foot down at one point that's when I hit down medium kick right and depending on what active frame you hit this on it'll be anywhere from plus two to plus four okay if it hits right and it will beat wake up buttons so if it counter hits whoops if it counter hits we can go into back heavy punch you know into whatever knockdown we like if it hits normally we should always be able to combo into medium punch and then you can spend as much meter as you want to or don't want to and then if it's blocked we don't get as much as I would like right we're not in throw range we are plus but we're not in throw range and while you can catch mashing with a crouch jab it can be inconsistent as to whether or not that medium or the light dema at the end will combo so it's kind of hard to extend off of it what you can do if you know they're not going to match a light is you can go into stance or gladius right and then that should interrupt or punish them if they're mashing right so you can kind of look at it that way as well of course the last thing you can do if you don't want to take a ton of risk is just dry rush into a regular throw which is obviously going to be mashing and parry the next knockdown I want look at is medium demo leaves us at plus 36 and relatively close so the very first auto timed option I want to look at is going to be dry rush into charge towards heavy kick so you'll see this will be mashing and you have a plus 16 so you can go into another towards heavy kick if you want but really that's just choosing to do a tougher link for no extra damage so I kind of like doing back heavy punch here just cuz it gives you a long time to kind of confirm it right and it doesn't lose any damage right you're just losing like a smidge of corner carry midcreen not a big deal okay if they try to jump you're plus 14 again you can either go into towards heavy kick or back heavy punch choice is yours on block you're going to be plus seven okay you are in throw range but if I do this throw immediately it'll whiff so you actually need to delay it a little bit otherwise you won't grab them but if you do delay it properly you'll beat their button so it's a good setup and then you can also set up trades with your stam medium kick into stuff like this right and against some characters the advantage is going to be different you'll probably be able to get back heavy punch versus some normals or others that's up to you to experiment with this does have an advantage over the charge towards heavy punch in that no one can walk back out of this okay at plus even though you're only plus seven you're way closer so you can force a command grab mix here a little bit you have to be careful because once again if they mash a button when you're going for this command grab it'll hit after your armor but before the grab comes out so you do have to be careful you can also do a fully charged overhead that is also an auto timed option it's plus six on block so you can like frame trap with back heavy punch um there's not a whole lot of other great things you can do here i guess that's pretty tight um obviously they can mash in between they can mash a DP after the second hit of the in between the hits of the target combo but they're not reacting to that that is a guess so they're kind of taking their life in their own hands just assuming you're going to keep pushing so not entirely safe for them to do that of course you can also do a manually timed command grab my cue for this is like the cue for the crouch medium kick off of the light demo which is big step that's when you input the command grab of course you can also do a regular throw you just have to manually time it correctly yikes okay there we go i can get it and once again the new option of drive crutch medium kick so you have to let Mara run here for quite a while kind of my visual cue is like when I'm right on their face that's when I push it like when I'm just right next to him important to note though you see there it says I'm minus two that's because I push down before I push medium kick so you're at the point where the drive rush will end if you push a button so you have to push the down and medium kick at the same time if you want to get this okay i do like this though because a lot of times when you run this far off in their face they're going to think you're going to want to command grab them so that's good because against jump of course or plus seven and we can combo into stand medium punch lastly we can bait a drive reversal by doing a heavy Superman punch and then just holding back this will catch wake up buttons into plus 47 it'll catch wake up jump okay and on block it's plus seven so you can continue to kind of pressure with stuff like this or this and that actually sets up a spacing trap midcreen so let me show that crouching medium kick uh after blocking four things so if I do this correctly I can do something like that so you have some pretty decent options for medium demo the next knockdown I want to look at is command grab so midscreen this doesn't really give you too much um you can lock them down with like a dry rush to a medium punch so if they try to mash you can get them what you'll notice here is you're kind of far away and your advantage is going to depend on the button you can usually do crouch medium punch dry brush but that's kind of an expensive spend um so I prefer to just kind of do this if I think that they're going to mash just kind of commit to doing that and eh if I get blown up for doing the target combo I get blown up for doing the hard combo my main thing is just I don't want them to get out for free because again this will also catch jump out so you just confirm into this in medium dema if they jump you can also if you don't care about trades you can do drive rush into stand medium kick but you can see full screen or you see excuse me midcreen your ability to combo off this is going to vary depending on the normal you trade with so it's really going to be character dependent um here I have Akuma doing stand light punch but if I have him do crouch light punch for example like there I'm only plus 12 so this doesn't work anymore i'm not in range for back heavy punch so if I want to convert off of it I need to do like a stand heavy punch which again is a conversion but your mileage will vary depending on what you trade with this used to be very good uh thing to do is this walk up into charge sweep not because it's a meaty but because if they hold backwards if they like are just trying to walk out you'll trigger proximity guard but because of the change to sweep knockdowns in this patch they can back recover this you used to just get like a command grab here and now they can just back recover and they don't take that mix midscreen so it's nowhere near as good as it used to be just because the Oi afterwards is kind of dead so midcreen she doesn't get much in the corner after command grab she also doesn't get a bunch of new setups but she does get a few new things most notably that I like is she can do this charged heavy punch and if they wake up with a button this will either trade and you're always plus enough to do this and obviously if you're playing a Sakuma I can probably kill for one bar here now not quite okay or if you're a little bit late you'll often like get a whiff punish on it and then of course you can combo it into that again if they try to jump they'll get flipped out and then you can either go for this or if you're quick you can do like stam medium punch to reset and that can be kind of tricky and then on block you're plus four okay so you can kind of harass with stuff like this or you can just wait for a parry and try to walk up and throw them or this also once again sets up that spacing trap idea so if they try to mash crouch medium kick they get blown up right that's the idea next I want to talk about heavy dema and all the different follow-ups so I want to start by doing nothing and just empty jumping so here we're plus 13 which is really good for us because it allows us to do a media stand medium kick which ends up being plus one on block and that is safe to wake up drive reversal obviously pretty strong this is even better than it was last season where it was already pretty good because now we can actually complete this combo and we couldn't do that last season that would uh not connect and now we can actually convert so we actually can kind of force them to not want to mash here which is obviously pretty strong you can also do empty jump into command grab and that will in fact beat wake up buttons going right you can also do a towards heavy kick oops and you can drivers cancel it and that'll give you a big combo on hit and a mix up on block so if I have him jab here you'll see if I do command grab there it catches mashing and then I can also do like a delayed stand medium kick to catch mashing or jump out right so or if you just want to keep things tight you can do towards heavy kick into like gladius for the drivegate damage and the spacing trap setup okay so that's it for the empty jump options what else can we do after heavy demo well there's also overhead which leaves us at plus 41 and sets up a pseudo safe jump i say pseudo safe jump because it will work against OD reversals that's on block excuse me it'll work against ODPS but it will not work against light DPS so you do have to be a little bit careful about that um I think I can count on like one hand the amount of times I've been light dpded on this setup people generally don't know it they just go "Oh it's a safe jump and it sort of isn't." Okay if this manages to hit for some reason like they're jumping out or something the worst that it can be if you do this late right which you should be doing pushing it as late as possible is plus 10 so you're always able to combo into back heavy punch which is a pretty significant amount of damage on block you are always plus seven so you can make this be a block string you can go into this or you can go back heavy punch into like gladius for kind of maximum drive damage you can of course also set up a command grab that they can't walk out of but again you're plus seven so be careful if they mash like a four-frame you will get hit there you'll also be able to get thrown if they attack okay so that's sort of it for the safe jump i just do want to show real quick you most people's probably know this by now but this will cross them up if they rise in place but none of the frames or anything change at all the next option I want to look at from heavy demo is this charged heavy punch just doing one of them there's a number of kind of options we can go for here that I think are fairly strong so plus 47 means we can forward dash and charge towards heavy kick we're plus three so we can just throw immediately if they block and we'll catch them we can also frame trap with stand light kick or excuse me stand light punch into whatever ender spend how muchever meter you would like to spend that's good we can also do a actually let me show this on hit real quick okay you're going to be able to link into back heavy punch and that's true if they jump out as well right so good reward on hit good reward on block you also are close enough now to command grab here let me show that and they still can't walk back out of it okay but it's actually maybe a little better at plus three because your armor will trigger if they mash jab right if they obviously if they mash low you'll lose right even something like crouch medium kick right but if they mash like their fastest normal your armor will trigger so it's maybe a little better even off the non-driver version okay what else can you do here well there's not a lot else that you can do that's auto time but there's a lot of manually time stuff that I think is very strong and has some merit so the first thing is drive rush into low forward right driver rush crouch medium kick just kind of have to wait till you're right in their face again boom in their face hit it boom in their face hit it right and again that's strong because of the changes to parry so that you're forcing him to guess high or low and you can mix that with either drive rush into standing kick that's slightly delayed or dry rush into a crutch medium punch that's going to have like the same timing as a crutch medium kick so like boom they're in their in their face okay and if they mash on this we counter hit into back heavy punch we counter hit into back heavy punch right so it just gives us more options okay same thing if they jump out whoops in a stand medium punch right they jump out in a stand medium punch so we get the same combo no matter if we go for crutch medium kick or crouch medium punch but they have to parry them differently seems pretty good you can also do a slight delay on a command grab and you can grab their button as well so that sort of makes it scary for them to try parry at all even if you know like oh well I'm I can get a perfect parry on the crouch medium punch and you know get a regular parry on the crouch medium kick well you can still command grab there and make the parry scary too okay so that's going to just about do it for the charged heavy punch follow-up from heavy demo the last heavy demo situation I want to look at is what I think is kind of the bog standard answer which is drive rush back heavy punch into heavy superman punch there's really only a couple of options here that are really strong but I like drive rush dash into drive rush crush medium punch is good plus 11 on counter hit so we can always combo into back heavy punch even if they jump out because this hits me i'm terrible no execution there we go right so it always combos into back heavy punch and that is also the same thing for driver crouch medium kick it will always combo into back heavy punch whether it hits counter hit or regular hit really strong and again they have to parry those things differently the especially strong thing though is that this drive rush crush medium punch ends up being safe to drive reversal so they can't really feel comfortable doing that either of course characters with a DP can on reaction to this drive rush DP so this is more of a setup against characters that lack an instable reversal or against people that you don't think are very DP happy the next setup I want to look at is from ODMA we do drive rush towards heavy kick target combo and then jump medium punch leaves is a plus 34 nothing really changed here from season 2 season 2.5 but it's kind of my baby setup so I just want to include it in this video so primary things you want to do are either walk forward and just manually counter throw which as you can see beats wake up buttons or as soon as they land you want to charge this towards heavy kick which is plus four on block and is also going to allow you to get a throw you'll just have to like walk for like a single frame and you'll be fine and of course that will also catch wake up buttons wake up jump whatever we are finally to corner situations so first things first off of medium hunch combo you should never go into medium dema when you're in the corner you should always go into Gladius they have the exact same frame advantage the only drawback is midscreen gladius pushes them way over there where medium dema keeps them close in the corner obviously that isn't an issue so what do we do with plus 36 here in the corner that we can't do midcreen cuz all the midscreen stuff will still work well the main thing are going to be frame kills right so first things first let's look at what I think is the strongest new option that quite frankly is pretty ridiculous so we withstand light punch as a frame kill now that has historically set up some good stuff for us because it lets us do like a manually timed command grab or a chargeback heavy punch right and that chargeback heavy punch is going to catch mashing and combo into heavy kick for a buttload of damage but now we actually have something off of this frame kill that is even better because they changed the frame advantage on our crouch light kick so on block this is plus three that's no different so that means we get a throw okay but if it hits on counter hit that's now plus 10 so we can combo into back heavy punch that's 28% meterless off of a crouch light kick right and if they try to like jump out because you know we could also do that we could also do like a command grab here right it's plus eight and we can still combo into back heavy punch right 28% off of a crouch light kick meterlessly and like optimally you know like maximally you know that's 55% almost off of a crouch light kick which is pretty tremendous okay but the fun doesn't stop there right because if they drive reversal on wake up wouldn't you know it of course that's also safe against wake up drive reversal but remember how I showed we could throw there well we can also shimmy and I'm not talking about shimmying delay tech we just hold back and shimmy an immediate throw gg's shake my hand from a crouch light kick are you kidding me so we're plus three this is like Mariza actually gets to play like Street Fighter 6 here you know strike throw shimmy strike throw shimmy baby this setup is ridiculous obviously weakness you're only plus 17 on this dry brush so if they DP you can't block it you can do some kind of insane things like dry rush DI or slightly less insane dry rush OD Gladius right so obviously this is going to lose to wake up throw but it should be wake up button it is going to get neutral jumped pretty hard okay it's not super susceptible to perfect carry because it hits so late but again if they do wake up throw or jump which again they certainly have incentive to do that you're losing three bars and you probably got back thrown and it's not that good but if you're just you know calling out a DP I promise you will feel like a genius if you do that okay i promise you you will feel like a genius if you do that okay what other corner situations do we have well we can of course do a safe jump with the charged heavies and then they're plus 18 on block so you can frame trap with the charge back heavy punch or you can do a regular one and just do it towards heavy kick that's also fine last corner situation I really want to look at is off of forward throw so we're plus 23 we can do drive rush into throw for that kind of metered throw loop idea right so if we time it correctly we grab them and we force him to attack we can also do drive rush into immediate stand heavy punch right and even on regular hit that will combo into back heavy punch cuz we hit on the second active frame it also means that if they just block it out we're plus two and if we do throw immediately we are in range we can also once again just hold back and shimmy him which is obviously pretty strong or of course we can frame trap with either strike or throw okay so this was obviously not comprehensive right there's other knockdowns we could look at and we'll probably put out videos in the future examining some of those things but for now I think that's going to get a lot of y'all started at the start of season 3 hopefully this is helpful as always have a good
