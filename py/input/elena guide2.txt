elena has officially rolled her way into street fighter 6 with a unique play style focusing on space control hit confirms highload mix and a dash of shenanigans elena offers a refreshing take on the street fighter 6 engine now that i've reached ultimate master with elena here's my rapidfire tips and tricks you need to get your elena to master rank fast while of course saving the best for last we'll start with what you're here for though the cheese you need to quickly scrub out wins which i personally spammed on my path to master rank spin scythe is your basic combo ender working on crouching or standing opponents you can confirm into light spin scythe from crushing light punch as a basic safe breadandbut combo spin scythe can then be canceled into link's whirl the enhanced version of lena's new roll move giving you access to plus unblock reset opportunities with some mix out of links whirl the forward lightkick ender leopard snap is going to be your default option to frame trap people challenging your pressure with their light normals midscreen if the leopard snap hits the opponent you can juggle with od rhino horn you have more combo options in the corner including lightkick rhino horn which can be cancelceled to level three heavy kick dp or more advanced dry rush combos [Music] leopard snap is also plus on block at plus one you can continue the pressure with crouching light punch and if you get counter hit you can confirm into spin scythe and loop the sequence again on day one i legitimately beat most of my opponents by looping this sequence people do not want to block and respect the pressure so definitely use it and abuse it while you can once opponents have been conditioned to block and respect the leopard snap option you can then reset with elena's overhead mallet smash by ending the link's whirl and board plus heavy kick mallet smash loses to buttons but hits overhead is plus on block and leads to combos on hit on regular hit you can combo into crack and life punch confirming into spin sight again at plus three on block you can go for throw or frame trap withstand medium kick elena's plus unblock normal useful for pressure and combo strings leopard snap and mouth smash have a gap in the sequence so both of them of course lose to invincible reversals but on top of that they also lose to reversal di to counter both these option this is where the mind games begin you can do link's whirl into no ender you can then block and punish a reversal attempt [Music] counter a di with your own or throw an attempted parry you can also try to mix people up expecting the overhead by going into crouching light kick to convert into a light combo but this empty roll leaves you at negative three so players not scared or conditioned by your leopard snap might challenge you with their buttons and win next you need to know your game plan for your standard poke into dry brush cancel elena's crouching medium kick is not special cancelable so instead you'll be using crouching medium punch to fish for whiff punishes and to force the opponent into block stun with your drive rush cancel pressure you of course have the standard crouching medium punch dry rush cancel into crouching light punch to set up her tick throw but her crouching medium punch is unique in that it deals more block stun so you can dry rush cancel into standing medium kick for a true block string leaving you plus five on block this is strong because on hit crouching medium kick driver's cancel into standing medium kick is a natural combo and on block leads to powerful block string pressure that can convert counter hits into combos as well making going into the standing medium kick a safe default option whenever you use crashing medium punch drivers cancel if you know your crouching medium punch is going to hit then here is your basic driver's combo to cash out on all your resources for big damage time for some unique elena strengths and may be her best button to abuse you may already know how to use standing heavy punch turret combo as a reversal punish using the blowback effect on punish counter to start big combos standing heavy punch however can also be used extremely well in neutral fishing for hit confirms for people walking into range of the button and for whiff punishing into big damage the second part of the target combo whiffs on croucher so you need to make sure to hit confirm before going into the second hit but this is very easy to confirm without a punish counter you get some basic combo conversions if you manage to whiff punish their butt and get the punish counter however you can get huge damage with consistent conversions you also get unique combo conversions from whiff punish spacing like this double level one combo i recommend to use this button heavily in neutral to control space and convert into big damage elena stand medium punch chucker combo works a lot like your standing heavy punch one it's great for whiff punching and hit confirming on opponents trying to walk into range but it's also a whole four frames faster as well the trade-off for this move however is that the first hit of the target combo does not force stand meaning this will not work on crouching opponents you also get less damage on hit confirms without dry rush cancel usually only netting an od spin scythe conversion at best on the other hand you can dry brush cancel the second hit for full combo conversions making it a great poke and whip punish tool to cash out with remember combos without dry brush cancel are much more meter efficient and allow your drive gauge to regen faster so be mindful of how you spend your meter next this might be my favorite move from elena ford heavy punch is an absolute monster poke with insane range and the two heavy punch follow-up turret combo is the easiest of her target combos to hit confirm this button is amazing to harass with in neutral and confirm into knockdowns i love pressing this thing ford medium kick is the most unique overhead in the game and a really fun tool in alena's kit as a 20 frame overhead with tons of range and the ability to confirm it with its starter combo to a knockdown this move is great to fish for in neutral as well as mixing people up in the corner it's negative two on block with a decent amount of push back making it safe to use at range or up close i won a ton of rounds by knocking people down in the corner and harassing them with a mix of forward medium kick for the overhead and crashing medium kick pokes for the low it works wonders to tear through people's defenses one issue elena can run into is closing the gap on opponents who like to walk away from her to build space her downforward heavy kick slide is a good albeit risky and committ tool for preventing people from getting too comfortable walking away from her footsie range however i became fond of using the link song roll into the forward leg kick leopard snap ender to harass opponents at a distance instead while negative five on block this move has a ton of push back to set up spacing traps being in link's role also gives you the option to mix in another roll to get the enhanced leopard stamp for plus frames on block if the opponent claims up or to sneak in a mallet smash overhead instead leopard snap also solves a major issue with the lane's throw game elena does have a thor loop in the corner sort of you need to use dry brush and spin a bar to get in range after a throw but it's literally a one-frame window to time the throw so that it's both in range but also beats wake up four-frame lights from the opponent try it it's seriously hard to do this means you need options here to scare the opponent from pressing buttons on wake up and leopard snap does just that leopard snap after throw hits me and beats wake up buttons it's also hit confirmable to level three it's di safe as well allowing you to recover and di back in time after a throw some basic options would be to mix in meaty leopard snap and meaty overhead to keep the opponent guessing as well as drive rush crashing like pressure and eventually drive rush into another throw and finally for my best and final tip you should practice your anti-airs what you thought you'd get through one of these videos without me preaching fundamentals but don't worry after this i do have one more ultra secret top tier tip so stay tuned elena has a pretty strong uppercut with a high vertical hitbox the light one hits slightly more above her head and the heavy slightly further out horizontally but for most standard jumpins i found the heavy kick version to work effectively and do the most damage you will need to cross cut though at certain ranges to cover for the lack of hitbox above and behind your head look you can use crouching heavy punch as an anti-air if you need to but learning to anti-air dp will get you so much further in street fighter if you can anti-air you can get to master rank this fundamental skill will get you so far in this game and is transferable between characters and if you want some help on learning how to uppercut more effectively on a leverless controller i have a video for that here and if you want to learn how to cross cut more effectively on any controller i have a video covering that here and for my final ultra super secret top tier tip if you ko with level two into healing you plant pretty flowers for your opponent to nap it thanks for watching
