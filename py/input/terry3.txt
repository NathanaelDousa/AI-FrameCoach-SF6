what up everybody season 3 is here and our boy Terry Borgard is eating nice but you already knew that this guy's the goat capcom didn't have to give him all the changes they did but I'm glad they did and I thought it would be a cool idea to make a video of 10 things that you should implement into your Terry game that are exclusive to him in season 3 i'm not saying ignore what you learned in season 2 those are still extremely powerful and good to know but you add these to your current arsenal and as they say you're going to watch the money pile up let's get into it all right so if you saw my patch last week you're going to know that I already mentioned one of Terry shimies because quick burn reaches further now if you end a combo in three lights into the quick burn and you just hold back I'm holding back the entire time that animation is going you're going to get off the perfect shimmy timing and obviously if Terry gets the shimmy off it's crouch medium punch into heavy tackle whatever you want but the fact that he has another shimmy option is a huge boon for him but you see players are getting smarter they don't like getting hit by shimmies and I don't blame them so now what you're going to see a lot is after you hit them with the three light string and you go for a shimmy or you go for a cheeky grab they're going to back dash after so first thing you got to hit them with the Albert Wesker when they back dash you [ __ ] so now that you got that out of your system this is what you got to do for people that like to back dash so there's actually four options you can do and I'm going to show you them all some are more consistent and I'll let you know which ones those are but let's get into it all right so the first thing is about ending with a fierce punch after the quick burn so it's going to look something like this now the reason I mention this is because it's a bit inconsistent there i got the two hits so obviously if you get the two hits off you can go to dry rush you can go into the power tackle like that the medium version but this is very tight timing wise because sometimes even if you mash it you only get one hit off it's still better than nothing and it still covers a long range if your opponent moves back but Stan Fierce is the most inconsistent but still worth doing so the next thing that stuffs the back dash is a crouch medium punch so after the quick burn combo if you hit them with a jab you're going to hit them out of the back dash in this situation you can actually combo a stand jab after like you see over there but at this distance the quick burn will not combo so you have to mentally tell yourself if you hit the medium punch into a stand jab go into his jab combo maybe this is what you need to get the kill or something like that but just keep in mind if you hit them with a crouch medium punch and you get the stand jab off the quick burn will not hit but in my opinion by far the best way to end these combos are either with a stand jab or a crouch leg kick and I'm going to tell you why the first is one they're extremely quick as you can see after this move how mashing jab they're not going anywhere i got two hits off even if I'm to do the crouch lightkick version so if you see this I can get two crouch light kicks off that's how fast they are and you can see Ryu couldn't back dash until the second hit and you're going to ask why this is important i'm going to tell you why it's important it's important because both these light options can continue the quick burn vortex loop yes I called it a vortex i'm an old head so this is what it's going to look like you can mass jab you get the second hit off you just keep going but the beauty of this part now is that the crouch leg kick will also work into a crouch leg kick into a stand jab why is that important well your opponent has to block a crouch leg kick low so now it just another layer that if they don't block low you might be able to expose their legs like you see over here and continue the combo so I recommend either ending with a stand jab or a crouch leg kick but go through the options and see what works best for you but this is a great tool to annoy your opponent all right now I love this next tip because it actually baits out supers that go through fireballs so as you know Tererry's fireballs they're not the best they're not the worst but you don't want to be in a situation where you throw a fireball and they hit you with a lar especially on wake up where they hit you with like a level two super that goes through fireballs so often times you'll see a situation like this you know you're going to hit them with a quick burn you're going to go into a fireball and then they're going to just hit you with a super that goes through it but there's a setup that actually baits out the vast majority of fireball supras in this game so the way you want to do this variation is after you get the three hit crack shoot so not over there you see this one hits three times you do a sweep after that sweep hits them you hit them with a a medium punch version of the power wave right after so in practice it'll look something like this do a quick sweep medium punch version of power wave and I just hold block and this gets Zangie's level two right out of the way but it's not only Zangief check this out so it works against pretty much every anti- invincible fireball super like here's Bison's level two i don't got to worry about it here's Honda [Music] don't got to worry about it can parry it block it even characters like Elena and Akuma that have very farreaching level twos these are no chance now I know what you're going to ask the million-dollar question does it work against Cammy's insanely stupid level three well let's see taking bets oh no it loses i guess that's the end of this story you [ __ ] or is it too late so Cammy if you do it too late like you see on the screen right now like I get the three hits late she's going to get me no matter what just because this super is very fast but if you get the three hits a lot earlier in the sequence so hopefully I can get in this demonstration to show you I should be able to recover in time to get off the parry so Cam's takes a bit more practice you just have to cancel into the three hits a bit earlier but guess what it still works on her so try to get into your arsenal so here's another thing that I love about this setup is you can actually set them up to be in a very good fireball trap so if you hit them with the three hits like you see over here after the sweep you want to throw a light punch version of power wave this way they have to block it so if they're to block this on wake up and I set the computer to jump I can send it another one and I recover in time to do a DP like that this is great because if your opponent doesn't have a you know level three like camies that they can go through they have to block that and if they want to jump over it you're going to recover in time to get your DP off and this way you're still carrying that pressure you're going to eat away at their drive bar but you still keep the skies protected i love this setup so another very good setup to know is we're going to be able to turn this crouch medium punch into meaty which means it's going to be plus on block you set the opponent to block all as you can see if I hit them with this move now I'm minus one it's not my turn and we know from some of the older videos that I posted you know if you hit them with a combo that ends with the fierce punch DP quickly dash forward and hit crouch medium punch you'll get plus two but I'm here to show you there's another way to do it so the other way that you get this move to be very meaty or plus on block so you have to hit them with that new Terry combo so it'll be the tackle into the three hits of the crack shoot into the quick burn once you hit them with a quick burn you're going to quickly hold crouch do a jab as a frame kill and then on wake up hit them with a crouch medium punch and that will make you either plus one or plus two depending on your timing so it might look something like this [Music] and you see you get the plus two and of course if this move is plus two on hit with that setup that means it's going to be plus seven on hit when you actually get that hit off so if you're to play off this combo like this this crouch medium punch will combo into itself as you see two hits on the left side once you get that off go into your tackle go into your drive rush combos you just learned a new meaty setup all right because this sweep is faster now and Terry gets that three hit crack shoot combo you can actually get an overhead that is plus on block that's very meaty pretty easy so if you do his overhead right now as you can see it's plus two you can't combo after unless you get you know counter hit but now you can do a setup where if you hit them with the three hits like this go into the sweep quick frame kill with the jab and then do a stand fierce punch right now it was three frames which means I didn't do it fast enough but if I do it again as you see I get plus four at the bottom him very plus he can link a jab after and if they were to block this it would be neutral so it' be at zero so I can mass jab and we can trade learn this meaty setup but it doesn't end there the fact that this was buffed when you combined it with the buff that they gave to the OD crackshoot so the OD crackshoot actually snipes people higher in the air now before when you're facing a dip character like Cammy or demon flip a head stopen if you're lucky enough to get them with a crack shoot like is you'd often just go to the DP and you'd be plus 35 which is still good to dash in but now because the sweep is faster if you clip people high in the air and hit them with the sweep like that you're going to be plus 39 which is much better for your oki pressure this is such a little subtle change that wasn't possible before but now you're going to be right in their face going for your fierce punch whatever you want but this is a huge thing that combines two buffs his sweep and the EX crack shoot and now I want to talk to you about some level two math and everybody loves math but many of you know level two's been buffed it doesn't blow back as much now so you can go for a burning knuckle after drive rush for some swag combos but I've actually found ways to seal the deal in games now just because how much damage this does on punish counter now I'm going to set the opponent to be taking punish counter damage just to emulate if they whiffed a DP let's just say Ryu did a wake up DP if I just do a basic crouch fierce into that combo ending in a medium brain knuckle it does 47% and you're going to wonder why that number is important so the reason 47% of your health is important to know is if you're not a big health character like Honda Zang or Marissa it's not going to apply but as you can see at the top at you'll see Ryu's health is the exact same as the dry bar that he has left so it's in parallel lines with that this tells me if Ryu or any other normal health character's health ever goes into that threshold this combo is going to kill them no matter what so I don't have to think about a more optimal punish i know this is going to work right away and this helps me save a lot of mental math if you want to hit them with a bit more damage without you know doing a very hard combo you can hit them with the hard kick into the stand medium punch go to the same variation and the burning knuckle is still going to get them as you can see 48% of the health on a baby food easy combo so another thing that's much easier to do now because this roundhouse kick leaves you closer to the opponent it's easier to combo a crouch fierce in the corner so if a character has a DP like a Ryu or akuma where they stick really close to you it's very easy to get this off characters like Ken they get knocked further away so it's not going to work on them but now a combo like this is so easy to land and just look how much damage it does you're barely breaking a sweat wait for him to land 50% just like that and I'm telling you the more damage you can get out without having to think about it or doing crazy execution you're going to win a lot more games with this in the long run and just food for thought if you ever want to do it as like a corner setup for you know switching spots this combo also works extremely easy you can walk forward try to get the DP if you're close if not the burning knuckle will work and now one thing that helps his corner combo because his stand medium punch will go into the medium tackle before this combo would have been very expensive because he got a dry rush after and as you can see your bar just getting absolutely annihilated but now combos like this are very good to know because one look at my drive bar this essentially only costs two bars and I did 44% almost 45% of the health bar and that combo is brand new it wasn't possible before and if you have a level two available you don't have to go into that second version that uses drive bar if you just go into this basic route that you see over here so you see I mash out the super one hit 49% nearly 50% just like that that's a brand new combo and the reason I'm showing you this is not because it's swaggy not because it's hard you just have access to another 50% combo and another 45% combo without breaking a sweat keep this in your mind because the less you got to think the more games you're going to win now here's another sneaky change that I love because this one actually takes timing and you got to work on it it kind of reminds me of a Street Fighter 4 setup because it's not auto timed but Terry can actually get a safe jump off of his buster wave it might not work on this time cuz I didn't get the time right well I got on the first try as you can see plus 42 at the bottom i'm going to show you how I use a visual guide to help me get this safe jump but this one's going to take some practice but it's just fun to try it out as well so the goal to get this move to be above plus 40 is after you hit Ryu with a triple hit of the crack shoot you want to make sure he's off the screen completely when you do the level one see over there he's still on my screen so this is not going to be anywhere close but if I mash out this as fast as I can see Ryu's not on the screen when I hit this this should be in the plus 40 range see plus 41 it's not guaranteed and that's kind of why I love this so if you're facing an opponent that can't do anything against you know plus 4D jumpins just know if they're off the screen you're going to get a perfect safe jump on them but if you go into training mode work on your timing a bit you'll start to get this plus 42 like you see more consistent i love these kind kind of in pure type of you know setups because they really remind me of the old games you got to go on your feel how it looks but this is something you got to put in your arsenal and if something gets updated in the future where it's a lot easier obviously I'll let you know and then the last tip I got to give credit to Nurse Lee he came up with this insane spacing trap i'm just going to play it on the screen but now Terry has access to these new spacing traps because the quick burn hits further and as you can see if you're plus six or plus seven from further ranges you're going to be actually able to carry this loop further and further and it's just such an annoying obnoxious loop and if you can get it off you're not only going to be building tons of bar but you're going to slowly be inching them away from you and they're going to be going towards the corner so credit to nurse Lee i don't know how he thinks of this stuff but this is awesome go give him a follow i love it and that's the video i hope you liked it if you like this stuff let me know in the comment section do not forget any of the tips or setups I taught you from the old seasons cuz they still apply what you want to do is mix and match add what you learned here and you're going to be winning a lot more games with our boy Terry peace out everybody
