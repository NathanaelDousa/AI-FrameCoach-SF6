hey what's up everybody Terry's finally out and I'm going to show you everything you need to start playing Terry as effectively and powerfully as possible in no time at all let's take a look at his key normals standing light punch crouching medium punch crouching medium kick standing medium kick standing Hard Punch and standing hard kick standing light punch is tied with crouching light punch as Terry's fastest attack at four frames it has slightly better range than crouching light punch so you should try to end your light strings with standing light punch instead of crouching light punch to make sure your last hit always connects crouching medium punch is a six-frame special cancelable crouching medium attack this is a great button to use for both counter poking and for punishing minus 6 frame moves since on punish counter crouching medium punch combos into heavy power charge leading into huge damage combos especially in the corner one really special thing about crouching medium punch is that it is hit confirmable if you're really focusing being able to hit confirm this into the medium version of power charge is going to be really important because it leads to some of his best midscreen pressure setups crouchy medium kick crouching medium kick is your standard 8-frame shto style crouching medium kick aside from its great range it's also special cancelable which means you can drive Rush cancel for pressure on block or convert into a combo on hit standing medium kick is a ninef frame startup long range standing medium attack this move has slightly more range than his crouching medium kick so it's great to use as a poke and a Keep Out tool now one special thing about this move even though it's N9 frames on Startup up it's only minus two on block which means you're not going to be punished even if you do this close to the opponent while it's great for poking and keep out this move really shines when you're able to land a counter hit because it's plus seven if you have one bar of super you can link his level one super on counter hit after landing this move it does a lot of damage so aiming for this in neutral is a really powerful option for you standing heart punch is one of Terry's best normals but it range is a little bit funky it's pretty short for a standing heart punch but actually hits a little bit further than what the animation shows as you can see right here now there are a couple of really great things about standing Hard Punch first of all it's nine frame startup but it's only minus one on block secondly this move has two parts to it if you connect with just the tip of standing heart punch you'll only get one hit but at closer range you get two hits which makes this a very hit confirmable move and in case you guys are new to Street Fighter 6 just know that a hit confirmable minus one on block standing heavy punch is a really good tool to have in this game next is standing hard kick this move a little bit unconventional for a street fighter 6 move but it's an important move of his nonetheless standing hard KCK is 12 frame startup has pretty good range and it's only minus four on block this can be used in neutral as a punish counter when your opponent whiffs buttons or you can try to use it when you're shimmying your opponent to try to go for a crumple State into a combo when they with a throw unfortunately because this move is 12 frame start up it's a little bit hard to use as a reactionary whiff punish so I think it's kind of better to focus on crouching medium punch for both whiff punish es and shimmy attempts when you're first starting to learn this character while all of Terry's normals are really useful the ones you're going to be using the most in the mid-range and neutral are going to be all versions of his Fireball that's light medium heavy and the OD versions medium bur knuckle and the light medium and heavy versions of trck shoot with a particular emphasis on the light and medium versions just because the heavy version can be Drive impacted on reaction so it's not one of those moves you just want to throw out all the time your go-to anti-air is going to be the light version of his Rising tackle depending on spacing you can use the medium or heavy versions as well but just be careful because at closer range you do have a tendency to kind of scoop underneath the opponent with the medium or heavy versions so at this kind of a spacing you should always be focusing on the light version of his Rising tackle all versions of Terry's power charge are good moves but these are moves you're going to be wanting to use in combos because they're all super super negative on block so you don't want to throw these out whenever in the mid-range let's start off by talking with the light and medium versions of his Fireball so the light version travels really slow and is great for closing the Gap against your opponent you can just throw it out Dash behind it walk forward and you're going to be able to close the gap really easily it does have a special property where the light version actually travels under Fireballs it does have quite a bit of recovery so if your timing is a little bit off you won't be able to block a fireball that comes after you and you might get a trade if you're lucky so for Fireball Wars you're going to want to focus on the medium version now the medium version travels a lot faster than the light but it doesn't go full screen however the medium version will trade with fireballs and kind of get rid of them so if you're in a fireball War focus on the medium version throw that out to get rid of their Fireball and return back to neutral the heavy version of this move round wave is really special because it acts differently from all the other Fireballs that Terry has so it has really long start up at 29 frames has almost no range but if the opponent blocks this you're going to be left at plus five which means it's your turn to do whatever you want a really good technique is to cancel either the first or second hit of a standing Hard Punch into this to steal back your turn make your opponent guess to make sure that they don't know when to push buttons and you can just keep on bullying with this as much as you want it's really really strong the OD version is your skip neutral button because you can just throw this it travels full screen it moves really slowly and you can just walk forward or even just drive Rush behind it for a more expensive neutral skip option it's a pretty good move especially when combine with Drive rush so be sure to use this in the neutral when you're tired of playing neutral and you just want to get in the medum version of burn knuckle is another skip neutral tool and this move has some special properties if you make the opponent block this move at this spacing which is round start range you can actually make it plus so as you can see here Terry's Plus one and you'll know if you're Plus or not because the screen is going to shake let's take a look see how the screen shook a little bit that means you're plus if the screen doesn't shake that means you're either punishable up to minus 6 or you're going to be slightly minus like I said anywhere from like -5 to minus1 if if you don't space it properly the light medium and heavy versions of Terry's crack shoot kind of function the same way as bison scissor kicks but instead of being a quarter Circle forward it's a quarter Circle back input this is going to be minus three no matter how you space it as you can see this is the light version even Point Blank I'm always minus three which means Terry does lose his turn but you're not going to be punished be careful with the hard version because it does have a tendency to kind of just go right over crouching opponents so if you're going to use this make sure you're spacing it properly this one's only minus one and it's really really good especially for Drive gauge chip but again with this move it kind of functions the same way as the hard version of his burn knuckle it is susceptible to perfect paries and drive impact on reaction so try not to overuse the hard version of this all of Terry supers have invulnerability but his level one will lose to Fireballs because it doesn't have projectile invulnerability all three versions of your supers level one 2 and three will work against physical attacks so if you need to blow through somebody's move you can go for any one of those depending on how much meter you have let's take a look at Terry's basic game plan so Terry's game plan changes quite a bit depending on spacing so let's break it down into different spacing situations when far away from the opponent you'll want to focus on a typical Sho Style game by throwing light and medium Fireballs to either zone out and anti-air your opponent or to create a wall in front of you to safely close the gap at mid-range you'll want to use Terry's four advancing specials like medium burn knuckle and crack shoot to close the gap once you're just inside your crouching medium kick range you'll want to try and clip your opponent's toes with crouching medium kick Drive Rush unblock go into crouching light punch to set up a plus three strike throw shimmy mix and then run your mix up if you think they'll push a button go into crouching medium punch for a counter hit combo if you think they'll do a delayed throw you can walk back for a shimmy and punish with either crouching medium Punch or standing hard kick into any combo of your choice the hard version of rising tackle combos from lights so this is where you're going to be getting most of your knockdowns from going for a drive Rush mixup is what you should be focusing on after landing a hard Rising tackle combo after your drive Rush do a late crouching medium punch this will hit the opponent as soon as they get up and leave you at plus three frames within throw range after a hard Rising tackle in the corner I recommend whiff standing light punch two times as a frame kill this will leave you at plus five frames to set up your offense most of Terry's optimal Corner combos end in this route so I strongly recommend learning this Frame kill setup next we have medium power charge you're most likely going to be hit confirming this off of a crouching medium punch a really strong setup after medium power charge is to immediately jump forward into jumping hard kick this is a 42 frame safe jump so if your opponent tries to wake up with the reversal you'll be able to block and go for a big damage combo afterwards now Terry gets his best knockdown setups midscreen after he lands heavy power charge you'll most likely combo into this from standing heavy punch from heavy power charge do a light Fireball Drive rush and then do his medium punch medium kick hard kick Target combo then Dash forward once this will leave you at plus six frames right in your opponent's face so you can do whatever you want afterwards to mix your opponent oh and if you ever get tired of your opponent blocking you can always just drive rush into his overhead with forward Hard Punch your frame advantage on hit is going to change based on your knockdown but you'll be at least plus six at worse so you can always link into crouching medium punch after this let's take a look at Terry's throw game from my testing Terry doesn't get any guaranteed pressure from throw's midscreen but this changes a lot in the corner Terry does have a throw Loop but it's a manually timed one and it only has a two-frame window to land it successfully so I don't think it's really practical to rely on this in a real match instead after a throw immediately Dash forward and this will leave Terry at plus three frames from here you can go for a media attack to beat them pushing buttons or throw to push them blocking to beat people who do delay Tech on wake up you're going to have to back dash immediately after your forward Dash and then react with standing hard kick into a punish combo unfortunately Terry's backwalk speed is too slow To Shimmy after this Auto time setup and here are some important combos to get
