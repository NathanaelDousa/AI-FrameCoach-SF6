On Hit: -16...+8
On Block: -20...+4
Cancelable: Special
Notes: Can be done off of a back, neutral, or forward jump. Active until landing. Lower/farther angle increases advantage on hit/block. Air-to-air hit causes a knockdown with juggle potential as of May 2024 patch.

Notes: Can be done off of a back, neutral, or forward jump. Active until landing. Lower/farther angle increases advantage on hit/block. Kick strength changes trajectory: Light Kick is the farthest while Heavy Kick is the shortest. 20% damage scaling to followup combo hits. Less landing recovery on hit/block than on whiff.

Cancelable: 
Notes: Strength of the Kick changes the trajectory, does not change advantage or damage. Except for at point blank, Dhalsim recovers before the lobbed projectile can hit a grounded opponent, so the advantage is +29 from hitstun (+27 blockstun), assuming you count from the falling projectile hitting someone post-recovery.

Notes: LK+MK/MK+HK/LK+HK changes the trajectory, does not change advantage or damage. Except for at point blank, Dhalsim recovers before the lobbed projectile can hit a grounded opponent, so the advantage from any bouncing hit is +29 from hitstun (+25 blockstun), assuming you count from the falling projectile hitting someone post-recovery. The final ground explosion is +22 hitstun (+18 blockstun). Followup bouncing attack tracks opponent after the first bounce only.

Notes: Transitions Dhalsim into a levitation. On the ground only, using Down-Forward causes Dhalsim to move forward as he rises to levitate. Can also be used in the air, data in parenthesis. Can levitate forward/backward for the duration of the levitation and can use an aerial attack or special, which ends the levitation. Levitation can last up to ~140 frames from the ground or ~90 frames from the air. June 2025 patch: increased forward movement speed, but Heavy Punch no longer carries more momentum.
