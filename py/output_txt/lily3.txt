Here is the rewritten text:

Lily's fighting style is characterized by her use of clubs, which provide her with a range of options for both poking and close-range combat. One of her most effective normal attacks is her medium stand attack, which has the longest range among her normals and allows her to keep opponents at bay from a distance.

When opponents try to jump at Lily, she can counter with her forward special attack, which shoots up at a diagonal and can hit opponents attempting to jump over her head. However, if opponents are jumping directly above her, the attack may miss. In most cases, it will still be effective in knocking opponents out of the sky.

When opponents get past Lily's pokes, she has close-range options available. Her sand light attack allows her to quickly perform a knee strike and then push opponents away with her clubs. The attack pushes the opponent away on hit or block, providing a way for Lily to create distance.

If opponents block too much, Lily can switch to her neutral special, known as a command grab. This move works similarly to a normal throw, dealing more damage and throwing opponents across the screen. At a basic level, players can use this move to regain control of the match and return to poking from a distance with their medium attack.

It is recommended that beginners focus on mastering Lily's fundamentals before moving on to her other tools and strategies. This will help prevent overwhelming themselves with too much new information at once.
