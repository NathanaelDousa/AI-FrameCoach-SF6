Marissa: Gameplay Guide

Marissa is a big body character with slow movement speed, but she makes up for it with her high damage output. Here's an overview of her moveset:

Normals:
- Stan Job (stamina punch): 10 frames
- Stamina Kick: 15 frames
- Crouch Heavy Punch: 12 frames
- Crouch Heavy Kick: 13 frames

Command Normals:
- Overhead (Down Four, Heavy Punch): knocks down
- Medium Crouch Punch: cancelable into kick or heavy punch
- Crash Medium Punch: 14 frames
- Crash Heavy Kick: 15 frames

Target Combos:
- Jab-Jab combo: not cancellable, but can be canceled into another jab
- Light Gladius (jab-jab into light gladius): true block string with chip damage

Special Moves:
- Gladius (light, medium, and heavy versions): 70 frames (light), 19 frames (medium), and 22 frames (heavy) respectively. Higher levels cover more distance and deal more damage.
- Sparta Kick: good for closing distance
- Superman Punch: great for closing distance, plus two on block, non-punishable, and can't be easily drive impacted

Stance:
- Three follow-ups: Target as overhead, dark combo (sweep), and Command Pro. Stance can't be canceled from normal formats.

Focus Attack:
- Four different focus attacks: Chevy Punch, Gladius Set Up to Jump, Ex Launcher, and Airtight Combo. Airtight Combo is considered her best.

Dead Zone:
- Marissa has a dead zone where she can't enter reliably. To bypass this, use the jump Target combo which knocks down and allows for a good starting point for a rush-in.
