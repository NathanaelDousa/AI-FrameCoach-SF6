Notes: Jumps off the opponent's head on hit or on block, which then allows Rashid to perform any Jump attack after. The in-game frame meter's hit/block data assumes Rashid empty lands, so on-hit,he's actually incredibly advantagedin terms of when he can act. So much so that, in the corner where he doesn't travel away due to hitting the wall, on-hit he can combo Blitz Strike into every jumping attack from even the earliest Blitz Strike hit. On-block in the corner, he's around -9...-12. Forced knockdown on air hit.
