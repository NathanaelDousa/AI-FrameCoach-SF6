Here is a rewritten transcript of the video guide about Rasheed, a fighting game character:

**Introduction**

Welcome to our video guide on how to play Rasheed, a versatile and powerful character in your favorite fighting game. In this guide, we'll cover Rasheed's basics, advanced techniques, and some crazy combos that you can use to take down your opponents.

**Basic Techniques**

First, let's start with Rasheed's basic normals. His jump light kick is not very useful, but his jump medium kick is a great air-to-air option. His jump heavy punch is also a good choice for a preemptive air-to-air attack. Rasheed's sweep is decent, but it doesn't have much range.

**Advanced Techniques**

Now that we've covered the basics, let's move on to some advanced techniques. One of Rasheed's most useful normals is his crouch medium punch. This move has great range and can be used as a meaty attack to punish opponents who try to jump in on you. Another key technique is Rasheed's run. He can use this move to quickly close the distance between himself and his opponent, or to retreat from a bad position.

**Combos**

Now that we've covered some of Rasheed's basic and advanced techniques, let's talk about some combos you can use to take down your opponents. One of Rasheed's most popular combos is the "Eagle Spike" combo, which ends with a high-damage attack. This combo is very effective in the corner, where you can get a lot of extra damage.

**Ex Meter Combos**

Rasheed also has some great ex meter combos that you can use to extend your combos and deal even more damage. One example is the "Crouch Medium Punch" combo, which uses Rasheed's crouch medium punch as a meaty attack to punish opponents who try to jump in on you.

**Mix-Ups**

Rasheed is all about mix-ups, which means that he can use his normals and specials to create confusing situations for his opponents. One example of a mix-up is the "Dashboard Throw" combo, where Rasheed dashes forward and then throws his opponent. This combo is very effective in the corner, where you can get a lot of extra damage.
