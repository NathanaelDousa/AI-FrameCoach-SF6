As one of the most complex characters in the game, Jury requires strategy and practice to master her moveset. We'll dive into her normal moves, specials, and combos, as well as some tips and tricks for playing her effectively.

**Normal Moves**

Jury's normal moves are a key part of her arsenal, allowing her to pressure opponents and create openings for combos. Her standing medium punch is particularly useful, as it can be canceled into various special moves or used as a quick jab to keep opponents at bay. Her crouching light kick is also a great tool for zoning and keeping opponents from getting too close.

**Special Moves**

Jury's special moves are where she really shines. Her level one super, "Feng Shui," allows her to chain together normal attacks into a powerful combo. This move can be used to punish opponents who get too aggressive or to start a combo after a successful block. Her level two super, "Burnout," is another powerful tool that can be used to create distance and set up for a mix-up.

**Combos**

Jury's combos are some of the most complex in the game, but with practice, they can be executed flawlessly. Her heavy store combo, which starts with a crouching medium punch and ends with a jumping heavy kick, is particularly damaging and can be used to finish off opponents quickly. Her air-to-air combos are also incredibly powerful, allowing her to outmaneuver opponents in the air.

**Tips and Tricks**

When playing Jury, it's essential to focus on creating space and controlling the pace of the match. Use your normal moves to zone and keep opponents at bay, then look for opportunities to start a combo or use one of your special moves to turn the tide of battle. Don't be afraid to experiment with different combos and specials to find what works best for you.

**Conclusion**

Jury is an incredibly versatile character who can do just about anything on the battlefield. With practice and patience, you can master her complex moveset and become a formidable opponent in any match. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you next time!
