Here is the rewritten text in an objective, concise, and professional tone:

Terry's Normal Moves:
---------------------

* Standing Light Punch: 4-frame attack with slightly better range than Crouching Light Punch. Use this to end light strings and ensure a hit.
* Crouching Medium Punch: 6-frame special cancelable attack. This is useful for counter-poking and punishing minus-6 frame moves. It's also hit-confirmable, allowing you to lead into heavy power charge combos.
* Crouching Medium Kick: 8-frame shto-style kick with great range. This move is special cancelable and can be used for pressure or combo setup on hit.
* Standing Medium Kick: 9-frame startup long-range attack with slightly more range than Crouching Medium Kick. Use this to poke and keep out opponents, especially after landing a counter hit.

Terry's Fireballs:
-------------------

* Light Version: Slow-moving fireball great for closing the gap against opponents. It travels under fireballs but has significant recovery time.
* Medium Version: Faster-traveling fireball that trades with other fireballs and can be used to get rid of opponent's fireballs.
* Heavy Version (Round Wave): Long startup (29 frames) fireball with minimal range, but if blocked, Terry is left at plus-5 frames. This move is useful for stealing back the turn after an opponent blocks it.

Terry's Power Charge:
---------------------

All versions of Power Charge are good moves to use in combos due to their super negative on block property.

Basic Game Plan:
-----------------

* Far from opponent: Focus on typical Sho-style play with light and medium Fireballs to zone out or anti-air opponents.
* Mid-range: Use Terry's advancing specials like Medium Burn Knuckle and Crack Shoot to close the gap.
* Close range: Use Crouching Medium Kick, Drive Rush, and mix-ups for pressure.

Super Moves:
-------------

All supers have invulnerability, but Level 1 will lose to fireballs due to lack of projectile invulnerability. All three versions work against physical attacks.

Throw Game:
------------

Terry's throw game is limited, with no guaranteed pressure midscreen. In the corner, he has a manual throw loop with a two-frame window, but it may not be practical to rely on in a real match. After a throw, Dash forward and use media attacks or throws to mix up opponents.

Important Combos:
-----------------

* Medium Power Charge into Jumping Hard Kick: A 42-frame safe jump that can be used after a medium power charge.
* Heavy Power Charge into Target Combo: A combo setup that ends in a knockdown state, allowing for further mix-ups.
