**Honda Guide**

Hey, what's up guys? Welcome back to my channel! Today, I'm going to share with you my expertise on playing Honda, a character from the popular fighting game. This guide is focused on Season 2 of the game, so if you're new to this version, make sure to check out my other videos for an introduction.

**Getting into Sumo Smash**

First off, let's talk about getting into Sumo Smash. This is Honda's bread and butter move, and it can be a real game-changer in neutral or even in the corner. To get into Sumo Smash, you'll need to land a standing medium punch, followed by a down-forward heavy kick. From there, you can input the charge for Sumo Smash.

**Tips and Tricks**

Here are some additional tips to keep in mind when playing as Honda:

* Use your headbutts at the right range. Honda's headbutts are super powerful, but they also have a decent amount of startup time. Make sure you're using them at the right distance to maximize their damage.
* Don't forget about your OKI butt slams! These moves can be really scary for your opponents and can help you get in some extra damage.
* When you're in the corner, try to use your drive rush heavy kick to set up a meaty or even a crouching medium kick. This can lead to some crazy combos and leave your opponent reeling.

**Bonus Tips**

Here are a few bonus tips that I wanted to share with you guys:

* Safe jump setup: When you land Sumo Smash in the corner, try using Drive Rush heavy kick to set up a safe jump. This can be really effective at getting in some extra damage.
* Side switch combo: If you want to get really crazy, try setting up a side switch combo after landing Sumo Smash. This involves drive rushing into sweep and then canceling it again into super for some serious damage.

**That's It!**

And that's my guide on playing Honda! I hope this helps you guys out there who are looking to improve their gameplay with this character. Remember, practice makes perfect, so keep streaming and don't be afraid to try new things. Thanks for watching, and I'll catch you all in the next video!
