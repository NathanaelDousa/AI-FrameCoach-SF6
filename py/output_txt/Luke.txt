Here's a rewritten transcript of the video guide about playing as Luke in a fighting game:

**Introduction**

Welcome to our video guide on playing as Luke, one of the most iconic characters in the fighting game community. In this video, we'll be covering Luke's moveset, combos, and strategies for both casual and competitive play.

**Luke's Moveset**

Let's start with Luke's basic moveset. He has a variety of normal attacks, including punches and kicks, as well as some special moves like his flash knuckles. His flash knuckles are a key part of his offense, allowing him to create distance and combo opportunities.

**Combos**

Now let's talk about some combos you can do with Luke. One of the most basic is the crouching light punch, followed by two crouching medium punches. This combo does decent damage and sets up for more advanced combos.

Another important combo is the drive rush forward crouching medium punch, crouching heavy punch. This combo does a lot of damage and can be used to punish opponents who try to jump in on you.

**Drive Rush**

Speaking of drive rush, let's talk about how to use it effectively with Luke. Drive rush allows you to move quickly around the screen while also dealing some damage. You can use it to get in close to your opponent or to create distance and set up for a combo.

One key thing to note is that Luke's level two super can be canceled from drive rush, making it a great way to end a combo and rack up some big damage.

**Knockdowns**

Now let's talk about knockdowns. Knockdowns are an important part of any fighting game strategy, as they allow you to control the pace of the match and set up for more opportunities.

Luke has several options for knockdowns, including his light flash knuckle, medium punch, and heavy kick. Each of these moves can be used to create a knockdown situation, depending on your opponent's positioning and reaction time.

**Super Moves**

Finally, let's talk about Luke's super moves. Luke has three super levels: level one, level two, and level three. His level one super is a quick, high-priority move that can be canceled from drive rush, while his level two super does more damage but takes longer to charge.

His level three super is the most powerful of all, doing massive damage and creating a lot of knockdown opportunities. However, it also leaves Luke vulnerable for a short time after use, so you'll want to use it wisely.

**Frame Kills**

In addition to his combos and supers, Luke has several frame kills that can be used to punish opponents who try to jump in on him or react too slowly to his attacks.

One key example is the crouching light punch, followed by a whiffed stand heavy kick. This combo does a lot of damage and creates a knockdown situation, making it a great way to start a combo.
