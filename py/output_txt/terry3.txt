**Terry Bogard Season 3 Tips**

As we dive into the new season, I'm excited to share some key strategies for Terry Bogard. With his updated moveset and increased quick burn range, we can create new combos and setups that will give you an edge in competitive play.

Firstly, let's talk about ending with a fierce punch after the quick burn. This setup allows you to hit opponents out of the back dash and sets them up for future attacks. We'll also explore other options, such as crouch medium punch or stand jab, which can be used to stuff the back dash.

Next, we have a setup that baits out supers that go through fireballs. By using the three-hit crack shoot sweep, followed by a medium punch version of power wave, you can trap opponents and lead them into a super that gets canceled. This is especially useful against characters like Zangief, Bison, and Honda.

Another key strategy is to use Terry's crouch medium punch to create a meaty setup. By hitting opponents with the three-hit crack shoot quick burn, followed by a jab as a frame kill and then a crouch medium punch on wake-up, you can create a plus one or plus two situation that sets up for future combos.

We'll also explore some level two math and discuss how Terry's new sweep and EX crack shoot buffs allow for more aggressive play. With the ability to seal deals in games and punish counter-hits, we can take our gameplay to the next level.

Finally, let's talk about some sneaky changes that make Terry more formidable. One such setup is a safe jump off of his buster wave, which requires timing and practice to master. We'll also discuss a new spacing trap that allows us to carry opponents away from us and into the corner.

Remember, these tips are not meant to be used in isolation, but rather as part of your overall strategy. Mix and match what you've learned here with previous seasons' strategies to become an even more formidable Terry player.
