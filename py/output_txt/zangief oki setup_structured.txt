Here is a rewritten version of each section of the guide video transcript in a more readable format:

**Introduction**

The Street Fighter 6 character setup for Zang is discussed. The goal is to provide an overview of the character's strengths, weaknesses, and optimal combos.

**Basic Combos**

* Crouching light kick > crouching medium punch: plus 3 on block
* Standing light kick > drivers > crouching light punch: plus 10 on hit

**Advanced Combos**

* Crouching light kick > crouching medium punch > Lariat (or ex Lariat): plus 27 knockdown with Oki in the corner or close to the corner
* Standing light kick > drivers > crouching light punch > forward heavy punch: punish if opponent presses a four-frame button

**Defense**

* Zang has more life than average characters, making it possible to take more risks on defense.
* Try to block out instead of taking hits.
* Use perfect Parry or jump cancel SPDs to force defensive mixups.

**Level Two and Critical Art**

* Level two beats some heavies, mediums, and throws.
* Critical art can only be avoided by back dash or jump. It ends round at 4,800 Health (level three) or 5,300 Health (critical art).

**Jumping Out and Back Dashing**

* Jumping out of the corner: splash can connect if opponent is walking up for a throw.
* Back dashing: be careful not to get punished by an opponent's throw.

**Checking Drivers**

* Use crouching light kick to check drivers on reaction, without looking for them most of the time.

**Burn and Outstanding Heavy Punch**

* Burn outstanding heavy punch can be used to deal with Drive Impact. It can be done on reaction in neutral or after a button unblocked, as long as the button into drive impact has at least a four-frame gap between block stun and drive impact.
