Notes: Overdrive version bounces off of opponents on hit/block for a followup hit without needing to be held. Overdrive version is always considered a standard projectile, but only has one hit so will lose to most other Overdrive projectiles.Can hold the attack button to charge. Held version has two hits, but does not bounce off of opponents on hit/block -- however, held version can be followed up with Forward+Punch to throw two more fans, both of which will bounce off of opponents on hit/block.Flame Stock versions still have two hits per fan.
