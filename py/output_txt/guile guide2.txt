The standing heavy kick has undergone changes, allowing for hit confirms and punish counters into Sonic Hurricane. This additional damage can be advantageous in certain situations.

The meter gain from starting with Forward Heavy Punch has been adjusted, making it a viable option if timed correctly. Alternatively, players can use Sobat to accumulate meter.

The combo using Post Flat Combo, Sobat, and Sonic Hurricane is now more reliable, dealing around 4,000 damage. This combo can be used to regain space after the changes to Basukani.

The Forward Hard Kick on punishing counter has been buffed, making it a useful tool for punishing monsters. Players should learn how to use this move effectively.

Basukani has undergone significant nerfs, rendering side switching with it impossible. To adjust, players can focus on improving their DI defense and resource management.

The highest meterless damage combo deals 2,740 damage, while the drive gauge accumulation is around half a bar. Adjustments can be made to gain more meter and space away from the corner for slightly reduced damage.

A Forward Hard Punch combined with a three-hit combo deals around 2,690 damage, about 25% more than before. This allows players to create pressure on stage and find new ways for better positioning.

Players can choose between various options, such as dash-forward after drive impact into Sweep Target Combo or Flash Kick, which provides less damage but more space away from the corner.

The side switch setup using Hard Sonic Hurricane Drive Rush and input Forward Hard Kick deals around +9 damage. This setup is effective if the opponent tries to block it, but players should be aware that it may whiff on wake-up DPS attempts.

These changes have led to new discoveries and strategies in the game, including improved combo potential and resource management. Players are encouraged to experiment and find their own playstyles.
