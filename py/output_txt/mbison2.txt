Here is a rewritten version of the transcript from a video guide about the fighting game character Bison:

**Introduction**

Welcome to our Bison guide! In this comprehensive guide, we'll cover everything you need to know to play Bison effectively. From his moveset and combos to his defense and super strategies, we'll dive deep into what makes him tick.

**Neutral Game**

Bison's neutral game is all about setting up for a combo or baiting your opponent's attacks. His jump-in heavy punch is a great way to start a combo, while his crouching medium punch can be used to punish opponents who whiff an attack. The ex scissor kick is also a powerful tool for zoning and denying your opponent's approach.

**Combos**

Bison has a variety of combos that can be used to rack up damage and pressure your opponent. One of the most basic combos starts with a crouching medium punch, followed by an overhead, and finished off with a heavy bomb dash for back heavy kick. This combo is especially useful in the corner, where you can use the bomb explosion to add extra damage.

**Defense**

Bison's defense is all about being unpredictable and reacting quickly to your opponent's attacks. His parry system allows him to deflect an attack and then counter with a powerful combination. The crouching light punch can also be used as a way to bait an opponent's attack and then punish them with a combo.

**Super Strategies**

Bison has three levels of super, each with its own unique properties and uses. Level one is best used as a reversal on wake-up or if you're going to burn your opponent out. Level two is more situational and should be used when you have the meter to spare. Level three is his most powerful super and should only be used in the most dire of situations.

**Advanced Techniques**

For advanced players, Bison offers a range of techs and combos that can be used to take your game to the next level. One of the most complex combos starts with a bomb explosion, followed by an ex psycho crusher, and finished off with a regular head stomp. This combo is extremely damaging and should only be attempted by experienced players.
