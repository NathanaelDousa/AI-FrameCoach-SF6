Here is a rewritten transcript of the video guide about the fighting game character:

**Introduction**

Hey everyone, welcome back to our series on [Character Name] in [Game Name]. Today, we're going to be diving into the corner situations and frame traps that can help you take your gameplay to the next level.

**Medium Hunch Combo Corner Situation**

First up, let's look at what happens when we use the medium hunch combo in the corner. As you might expect, this setup is a bit different from what we see mid-screen. The main thing here is frame kills. We can start by using the light punch as a frame kill to set up some good stuff for us.

One of our strongest options off of this frame kill is a manually timed command grab or charge-back heavy punch. This will catch mashing and combo into a heavy kick for a ton of damage. But now we have something even better, thanks to the changed frame advantage on our crouch light kick. On block, this is plus three, which means we can get a throw. And if it hits on counter hit, that's plus 10, so we can combo into back heavy punch meterlessly.

We also have some options for drive reversal, including shimmying and throwing immediately. This is pretty strong stuff, especially considering we're only plus 17 on this dry brush. Of course, there are some weaknesses to be aware of, like losing three bars if they wake up throw or jump.

**Forward Throw Corner Situation**

Next, let's look at what happens when we use the forward throw in the corner. This setup is a bit different from what we see mid-screen as well. We're plus 23 here, so we have some good options for frame trapping and throwing.

One thing we can do is drive rush into throw to set up that kind of metered throw loop idea. If we time it correctly, we grab them and force them to attack, which gives us a chance to combo into back heavy punch. We also have the option to hold back and shimmy him, which is pretty strong.

**Conclusion**

That's it for today's video on [Character Name] in [Game Name]. I hope this helps you get started with some of the corner situations and frame traps that can help take your gameplay to the next level. As always, have a good one!
