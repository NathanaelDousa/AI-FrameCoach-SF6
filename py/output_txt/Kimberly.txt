Notes: Makes Kimberly jump cancel after the Hisen Kick, can be done both On-Hit and On-Block. Pressing Up/Up-Forward/Up-Back changes the followup jump angle. Can use any jump attack out of this jumping state, including Bushin Senpukyaku off of the Up-Forward version. The frame meter in game says "-10" doing the Step Up On-Hit and "-22" for On-Block, however that is how advantaged Kimberly is after doing nothing (empty landing). If Kimberly does a jump attack as soon as possible after Step Up, she is +2 On-Hit and -15 On-Block.
