**JP's Special Moves and Combos**

Standing Light Punch:
* Range allows for extending light attack strings
* Fast startup makes it a great tool for punishing moves, interrupting safe block strings, and frame trapping opponents when advantageous

Crouching Light Punch:
* Fastest button in JP's kit; used to punish moves, interrupt safe block strings, and frame trap opponents when advantageous

Standing Light Kick:
* Used to punish M. Bison's Scissor Kicks and has little other application
* Crouching Light Kick is JP's fastest low attack, used to open up the opponent on block

Jumping Light Punches (and Jumping Light Kick):
* Quick startup makes them great air-to-air tools; can cross up at certain angles, making them useful for opening up opponents

Standing Medium Punch:
* Slow, long-range poke that does impressive Drive gauge chip
* Crouching Medium Punch is a great Drive Rush check tool and combo filler

Crouching Medium Kick:
* Safe on block; advances low with great combo reward on hit
* Largest safe low in JP's kit, but watch out for attacks that can go under it

Jumping Medium Punch (and Jumping Medium Kick):
* Standing Medium Punch in the air; has absurd range and is a good defensive option
* Jumping Medium Kick is JP's strongest air-to-air tool, allowing for combos afterward

Heavy Punch:
* Unique juggle property makes it vital in combos; also a solid poke on its own
* Grants crumple State on punish counter, leading to additional damage

Crouching Heavy Punch:
* JP's go-to anti-air; fastest heavy normal, making it a good combo tool

Standing Heavy Kick (and Crouching Heavy Kick):
* Standing Heavy Kick is JP's only Plus on block normal that whiffs against crouching opponents at distance
* On hit or block, allows JP to start bowling the opponent
* Crouching Heavy Kick is a very niche tool with poor range but is safe after Drive Rush and fast enough for easy Oki after perfect Parry

Portals:
* Sets up zoning and mixup opportunities; takes 50 frames to set up portal
* When detonated, it has the same active frames as a Spike Special

Spike:
* Important zoning and combo tool; when zoning, assists JP in locking opponents down at long distances
* Good Ender due to range and juggle potential; minus two unblock but has 10 active frames

Swipe (Light, Medium, Heavy, OD):
* Primary special move combo tool; light version combos from light attacks, medium and OD versions combo from medium attacks, and heavy version only combos after Drive Rush or counter hit
* All four versions are frequently used in combos; most JP players choose Classic over Modern specifically because the Modern control scheme lacks the medium and heavy versions of this move

Fireballs (Light, Medium, Heavy):
* Light Fireball is a mid attack that sacrifices damage for active frames and knockdown SL juggle State on hit
* Medium Fireball is an overhead that is only active for one frame; crouching light punch can combo into it
* Heavy Fireball is a low with less combo applicability

OD Fireball:
* Active and locks the opponent more than any other move in JP's kit, allowing JP to reposition or set up a portal
* Great combo Ender, but watch out against certain characters

Teleport:
* Ranged command grab with long recovery; similar to Drive Impact

Level One Super:
* Strikes and throws vulnerable hits that become full-screen projectiles
* Use as reversal option or combo tool for extra damage; can combo off almost any hit

Level Two Super:
* Summons four Fireballs, the first hitting mid, second hitting overhead, third hitting low, and fourth hitting overhead
* Fireballs vanish if JP is hit; allows JP to move independently from the super

Level Three Super:
* Slow but full-screen; easy to confirm off combos from anywhere on the screen
* Critical art version grants JP more damage than Oki and will always put JP full screen from the opponent
