Notes: Counters Strike attacks (not throws or projectiles) from frame 3-18. Overdrive version counters Strikes and Throws, on frames 1-20. Overdrive data in parenthesis. For both versions, JP recovers before the hit, so On-Hit and On-block data are relative to other actions. Free Juggle State on hit. 17 frames of recovery on successful parry. In February 27, 2024 patch: now adds 50% damage scaling to 3rd hit when starting a combo or adds 60% damage scaling when comboed into. This was previously shown with Anti-air invuln in the hitbox GIF, but is actually fully strike invuln and has been corrected as of the June 2025 patch.
