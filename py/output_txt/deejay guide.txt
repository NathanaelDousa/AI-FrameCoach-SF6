**DJ's Fireball**

The light fireball (fame) can be useful in certain situations, but keep in mind that using this version will lose all your charge. When you use it, you may lose the opportunity to react to a heavy fireball and jump on top of it. However, if you do use this version, you can maintain your charge.

The heavy fireball is important to note because when an opponent walks away from the attack, their carrots (distance) will be moved back slightly, making it less effective. Use it thoughtfully to avoid jumping attacks.

**Drive Gauge Restoration**

When using the medium fireball, you can gain half of your drive gauge back, which is useful for regaining meter. Additionally, when charging, you can quickly restore drive gauge and potentially use a heavy fireball.

**Normal Moves**

DJ's standing light punch has a four-frame startup, while crouching light punch has a five-frame startup. When performing a combo that gets punished, you can use the standing heavy punch to recover plus five frames and then continue the combo with crouch light punch.

**Flash Kick**

The flash kick button is broken and only takes eight frames to execute. This allows for quick recovery from whiffed jumps or other situations where you need to quickly respond.

**Target Combo**

DJ's target combo can generate a significant amount of meter, especially when not having enough meter initially. The plus six block advantage makes it an attractive option.

**Drive Rush**

The drive rush button is useful for punishing opponents at the right range and has a plus advantage. When executing a back heavy kick combo, you can always follow up with a level one combo.

**Combos and Drive Gauge Management**

DJ's combos involve Drive gauge management, as using certain moves can spend or regain meter. The newest combo involves spending four drive bars to execute the max damage option.

**Drive Rush Combos**

When executing a drive rush combo, you can quickly generate meter and potentially use a level two or three combo. Keep in mind that mind games are essential when cornering an opponent.

**B Button Combo**

The B button combo is nerfed but still useful at the correct range. When opponents try to counter it, you can punish with a level three combo. This move can be canceled into various options.
