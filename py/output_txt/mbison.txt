**M. Bison Basic Game Plan**

To control space outside of mid-range, use M. Bison's light and medium double knee press. These moves are minus five on block but leave you at a safe distance if spaced properly.

**Drive Rush and Crouching Medium Punch/Kick**

Use Drive Rush from neutral to close the distance quickly. This move is the fastest in the game at close ranges. Use crouching medium punch and crouching medium kick to fish for counter hits and whiff punish opponents. These moves can also be used to approach from far away and confuse opponents with front-back mixups.

**Wind Condition**

M. Bison's wind condition involves landing a combo that ends with double combination near the corner, putting a bomb on the opponent and allowing for huge damage combos on hit.

**Basic Normals**

Focus on building your basic game plan around five normals: crouching light punch, crouching medium punch, crouching medium kick, standing hard punch, and back hard kick. Crouching light punch is M. Bison's best four-frame normal, minus two on block but leaving you in range for a tick throw.

**Combo Enders**

When comboing, aim to end with light double knee press midscreen or use the backfist combo, which can be canceled into Drive Rush after landing medium or hard versions.

**Anti-Airs**

M. Bison's main anti-air is crouching heart punch, available when opponents jump at you from mid-range. In situations where this move doesn't work, react to the opponent's jump and use his medium-medium target combo in the air.

**Throw Loops**

Set up throw loops by immediately dashing forward after a throw or using manual timing to hold forward and then time a throw. The second setup allows for shimmy mixups.

**Drive Rush Cancels**

When Drive Rushing, cancel into crouching medium punch or crouching medium kick to drive cancel. Crouching medium kick is a low, so focus on that for this guide.

**Screen Flash**

Use the screen flash during Drive cancel to check if your crouching medium kick was blocked or hit on block. Follow up with crouching light punch to leave yourself at plus two frames.

**Oki Setups Midscreen**

Choose between keeping pressure with double knee press or putting a bomb on the opponent by ending with backfist combo midscreen. Aim to end with light double knee press for Oki setups, but use backfist combo Enders if you can connect medium or hard versions.

**Conclusion**

M. Bison has various combos and setups; focus on learning these essential ones: combo into light or medium double knee press, drive rush, crouching medium punch/kick, throw loops, and screen flash.
