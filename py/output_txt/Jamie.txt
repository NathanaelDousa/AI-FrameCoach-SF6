Here is a rewritten transcript of the video guide about Jamie, a fighting game character:

**Neutral Tools**

Jamie has several neutral tools that can be used to control space and harass opponents. The first one is his forward heavy kick, which is a quick and easy-to-use tool for poking at opponents from a distance.

Another important neutral tool is his back heavy punch, which can be used to create space or punish opponents who are trying to get too close. However, this move has some limitations, such as being slow and not invincible.

Jamie also has a unique command grab that can be used to punish opponents who try to neutral jump. This move is particularly effective against characters who have poor anti-air options.

**Anti-Air Options**

When it comes to anti-airs, Jamie has several options available. One of his most reliable anti-aerials is his down heavy punch, which has a wide hitbox and can be used to punish opponents who try to jump in with aerial attacks.

Another effective anti-air option is his light kick DP, which has a decent hitbox and can be used to knock opponents back and create space. However, this move is not invincible and should be used carefully.

For more advanced players, Jamie's top-side kick (T side kick) is an excellent anti-air option that can be used to punish opponents who try to jump in with aerial attacks. This move has a wide hitbox and is designed specifically for anti-airs.
