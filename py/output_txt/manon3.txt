Here is a rewritten version of the transcript in an objective, concise, and professional tone:

The first key aspect of Manan's gameplay is her ability to earn medals quickly. This can be achieved by using her EX Upkick into Spin, which also provides decent damage if landed. Additionally, Manan has a five-frame punish that allows her to punish many moves that other characters cannot, including DJ's heavy kick and Ken's stand medium kicks.

Manan's stand light kick is particularly effective in punishing certain moves, and it can be used to force a mix-up or achieve a sliding knockdown if the opponent is close enough. It is recommended to practice and learn which moves are punishable with Manan's stand light kick.

Another important aspect of Manan's gameplay is buffering her lights. This involves canceling into specials behind light buttons, which can make it difficult for opponents to react. This technique is particularly effective in Street Fighter 5, where common spacing traps often involve using G and other characters' far-range buttons.

Hit confirming back heavy punch is also crucial for Manan players. This involves practicing hit confirms in training mode and building combos or damage with this move. It has a lenient window and is one of the easier hit confirms to master.

Finally, managing an opponent's Drive meter is essential when playing as Manan. Her stand heavy punch and stand heavy kick are particularly effective at draining the Drive meter, and players can intentionally target combo on block to zap the meter if needed. Another good string to use is back heavy punch into overhead, which takes a half-Drive meter or more.

By following these strategies and practicing her moves, Manan players can effectively harass their opponents' Drive meters and maintain an advantage in battle.
