**Aki's Moveset and Strategies**

As we dive deeper into Aki's kit, let's start with her normals. Her Crouch Heavy Kick is a great option for whiff punishes and can also be used to anti-air Ed's jumping medium kick. Another important normal is the Stand Light Kick, which can punish Ed's Light Punch Blitz from all ranges.

**Fireballs and Drive Rush**

Aki's Fireballs are very easy to punish with Venomous Fang. Additionally, her drive rush approach can be countered by doing a Fireball into Venomous Fang or OD Snake Step. This can hard-counter Ed's charged flicker Oki as it will still reach after Ed's forward throw in the corner.

**Wake-Up Options**

When waking up, Aki has several options to consider. Her Forward Jump Heavy Punch is a good choice against Akuma's viable. For Demon Flip, she can reliably punish with Stand Heavy Kick, which leads to a full juggle if executed correctly.

**General Tips and Tricks**

Some general tips to keep in mind include:

* Always be cautious when throwing Fireballs, as they can be easily punished.
* Use Venomous Fang wisely, as it has a small window for punishment.
* Consider using the buffer system to time your Level 2 super attack against Rasheed.
* Be mindful of Ed's charge flicker Oki and use Drive Impact OD Lash or Venomous Fang accordingly.

**Match-Ups**

Here are some specific match-up strategies:

* Against Chun-Li, Aki's Crouch Medium Kick is a great option to punish her Fireballs. Additionally, using Stand Light Punch buffered into Coward Crouch Roll can pick up combos.
* Against Guile, Aki's Venomous Fang can punish his Sonic Blade from distance. Also, consider using Drive Rush to pressure him and set up an Orchid Spring ready.
* Against Ken, Aki's Stand Heavy Kick can whiff punish his Dragon Lash. Additionally, consider using Drive Impact OD Lash or Venomous Fang to punish his Fireballs.

**Final Thoughts**

In conclusion, Aki is a versatile character with a wide range of options for punishes and combos. Remember to stay patient and adaptable in your matches, as her kit can be tricky to master. Thank you for watching, and I'll see you guys in the next video!
