**Lily Guide**

Lily is an underutilized character with a unique playstyle. Her best matches are in mid-range combat, utilizing her rushdown and pressure game.

**Combos (No Wind Stocks)**

* Stand Light Kick > Crouch Medium Punch: A basic combo that can be extended with level one.
* Stand Light Punch > Crash Light Punch: A more damaging combo that ends with a level one super.

**Pressure**

Lily's pressure is chain-based, using her lights to setup for command grabs. With wind stocks, she can get plus eight and create a loop of command grabs.

**Defense**

Lily's defense revolves around her universal mechanics, which are vulnerable to wake-up supers, perfect perry reversals, and anti-air attacks. Use her level one super as a wake-up option to deter opponents from being too aggressive.

**Fence**

Outside of universal mechanics, Lily doesn't have a fully invincible reversal. Her XDP throw is vulnerable in neutral and can be anti-aired. Wake up with level one super to get the opponent off you if they're trying to grab or jump.

**Conclusion**

This guide covers Lily's basic combos, pressure game, defense, and fence play. While there may be mistakes, this video aims to provide a general understanding of her playstyle.
