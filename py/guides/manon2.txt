Here is a rewritten transcript of the video guide on Manon, a fighting game character:

**Introduction**

Welcome back to our series on [game name] characters. Today, we're going to be exploring Manon, a straightforward yet formidable fighter. In this guide, we'll cover her moveset, strategies, and some tips for making the most of her abilities.

**Command Grab**

Manon's command grab is a powerful tool that can lead to big damage and knockdowns. It has a 7-frame startup, which means it can be canceled into from some of her special moves. The catch is that if your opponent tries to jump out after the flash, they'll still get grabbed.

**Level 1 Super**

Manon's level 1 super is a command grab that deals 4K damage at level 1 and scales with her medal level. It has a 7-frame startup and can be used as a reversal if it would kill. This super is particularly useful for punishing opponents who try to jump in or throw projectiles.

**Level 2 Super**

Manon's level 2 super is an invincible move that can be used as an anti-air or to punish opponents who try to jump out. It has a 10-frame startup and can be canceled into from some of her special moves.

**Level 3 Super**

Manon's level 3 super is a command grab that deals significant damage and scales with her medal level. While it doesn't have invincibility, it's still a powerful tool for finishing off opponents or setting up for more damage.

**General Strategies**

When playing as Manon, your goal should be to control the pace of the match and use your command grabs to rack up damage and knockdowns. Mix in some fake-outs and misdirection to keep your opponent guessing, and don't be afraid to use your supers to turn the tide of battle.

**Tips and Tricks**

* Use Manon's drive rush forward medium kick to create space and set up for a command grab.
* Cancel into Manon's level 1 super from her OD ballerina kick to deal big damage.
* Use Manon's level 2 super as an anti-air or to punish opponents who try to jump out.
