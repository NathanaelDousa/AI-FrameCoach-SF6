Introduction to Luke in Street Fighter 6:

Luke is an in-your-face fighter, focusing on getting close to opponents. He has simple combos that bring opponents closer, as well as medium-range options like Sandblast and anti-air moves.

Drive Meter Management:

Luke's special moves can be enhanced by spending an extra meter of the drive meter. However, this should be managed carefully, as Luke will quickly burn through his six available meters.

Avenger Special Move:

The Avenger special move is a full-screen option that hits opponents, making it effective against opponents trying to play keep-away. The enhanced version gains armor on the run-up, allowing for closer approaches and damage dealing.

Bread-and-Butter Starters:

Luke's low medium kick and jump-in medium kicks are bread-and-butter starters that can be combined with specials or supers. The low medium kick is a good cross-up option, and the jump-in medium kick is an overhead that can lead to special or super moves.

Combo Examples:

A simple combo example starts with an overhead low medium kick, followed by enhanced special move and another special move. Another combo starts with a low light kick into a light punch, leading to any special or super.

Light Combo:

Luke's light combo consists of three punches that can be canceled into any special or super. This combo is effective for setting up supers or specials.

Medium Combo:

The medium combo has four hits but appears to have limited follow-up options. It may be best to stick with the light combo in this case.

Ford Heavy Two-Punch Combo:

This combo does decent damage and can be canceled into a special or super, even if it doesn't get any additional hits.

Beginner Strategy:

For beginners, a recommended strategy is to keep opponents away with Sandblast and then use anti-air moves. When opponents approach, use low medium kicks to deal damage and set up for specials or supers.

Fun and Easy Combos:

Some fun and easy combos for Luke include jumping in with a medium kick, followed by any special move. In the corner, Drive Impact can be used as a combo starter, and back medium punches can lead to special moves.

Conclusion:

Luke is an aggressive fighter that excels at close range. This guide has provided some basic strategies and combos to help beginners get started with Luke in Street Fighter 6.
