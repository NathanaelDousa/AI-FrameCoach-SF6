**Elena's Basics and Strategies**

To quickly reach Master Rank with Elena, focus on space control, hit confirms, high-pressure mix-ups, and a dash of shenanigans. Start by mastering her basic combo ender, Spin Scythe, which can be confirmed into Light Spin Scythe from crushing light punches. This can be canceled into Link's Whirl, providing plus unblock reset opportunities.

**Leopard Snap and Overhead Mallet Smash**

Use Leopard Snap as a default option to frame trap opponents. If it hits, juggle with Od Rhino Horn or cancel to level three heavy kick DP. On block, continue pressure with crouching light punch. If counter-hit, confirm into Spin Scythe and loop the sequence.

**Reset Options**

Reset with Elena's overhead Mallet Smash by ending Link's Whirl and boarding plus-heavy kick. This move is plus on block, leading to combos on hit or regular hit. You can also throw or frame trap with medium kick.

**Mind Games**

Use Link's Whirl into no ender, then block and punish reversal attempts. Counter a DI with your own or throw an attempted parry. Mix up opponents by going into crouching light kick, converting to a light combo, but be aware that this empty roll leaves you at negative three.

**Standard Poke and Dry Brush**

Use crouching medium punch to fish for whiff punishes and force opponents into block stun with Drive Rush Cancel pressure. Crouching medium punch is unique in dealing more block stun, allowing for dry rush cancel into standing medium kick for a true block string.

**Unique Strengths**

Standing heavy punch (Turret Combo) is an excellent reversal punish using the blowback effect on punish counter to start big combos. It can also be used well in neutral, fishing for hit confirms and whiff punishing into big damage.

**Elena's Movesets**

* Standing medium kick (Chucker Combo): Works like standing heavy punch, but faster. The first hit of the target combo does not force stand, making it less effective on crouching opponents.
* Forward medium kick: A 20-frame overhead with tons of range and starter combo to knockdown.

**Anti-Airs**

Practice anti-airing with Elena's uppercut (heavy kick version works effectively for most standard jump-ins). Cross-cut at certain ranges to cover the lack of hitbox above and behind your head. Use crouching heavy punch as an anti-air if needed, but mastering DPs will get you further in Street Fighter.

**Additional Tips**

* Practice fundamentals like anti-airs to reach Master Rank.
* Use Link's roll into forward leg kick Leopard Snap ender to harass opponents at a distance.
* For a ultra-secret top-tier tip, use Level 2 into healing to plant pretty flowers for your opponent to nap.
