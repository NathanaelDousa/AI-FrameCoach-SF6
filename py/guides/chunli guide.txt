**Introduction**

Welcome back to my channel! Today, we're going to dive into the world of Chun-Li, one of the most iconic and complex characters in the Street Fighter series. As a player who has spent countless hours mastering her moveset, I'll be sharing some advanced techniques and strategies that will help you take your gameplay to the next level.

**Safe Jumps**

First up, let's talk about safe jumps. A safe jump is a fundamental concept in Chun-Li's gameplay, allowing you to get an extra hit or two on your opponent without risking getting counter-attacked. The key to successful safe jumping is timing - you need to delay the input for the throw just enough so that your opponent can't react in time.

One of the most effective ways to use safe jumps is to set up a "stomp" - this is when you jump and immediately hit the ground, creating a bouncing effect that sends your opponent flying. You can follow this up with various mix-ups, including throws, crouching light kicks, or even jumping heavy kicks.

**Oki Pressure**

Now, let's talk about Oki pressure. Oki refers to the art of using Chun-Li's aerials to create a sense of uncertainty and unpredictability in your opponent's mind. By mixing up your jump-ins and throws, you can create a "guess-who" situation that keeps your opponent off-balance.

One of my favorite Oki strategies is to use a "stomp-stomp-stomp" sequence - this involves jumping and immediately hitting the ground twice in a row, creating a sense of rhythm that's hard for your opponent to anticipate. You can follow this up with various combos or even throws, depending on your opponent's response.

**Combos and Block Strings**

Now that we've covered some basic safe jump setups and Oki pressure strategies, let's talk about some advanced combos and block strings you can use to take your gameplay to the next level.

For example, you can use a crouching medium kick followed by an instant stomp side switch to create a combo that's hard for your opponent to react to. Alternatively, you can string together a series of light kicks and punches to create a "juggling" effect that keeps your opponent in the air for as long as possible.

**Conclusion**

And there you have it - a basic overview of Chun-Li's gameplay and some advanced strategies you can use to take your gameplay to the next level. Remember to always mix up your Oki pressure and safe jumps, and don't be afraid to experiment with different combos and block strings to find what works best for you.
