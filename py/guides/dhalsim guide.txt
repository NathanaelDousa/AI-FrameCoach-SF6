**Unpredictable Poking**

When zoning or throwing fireballs, using more faints can be an effective strategy. This approach makes it difficult for opponents to anticipate and punish your poking attempts.

Additionally, attempting to tap parry rather than perfect parry can drain the opponent's meter when they miss a parry.

**Light Kick Utility**

The light kick button has good recovery time, making it useful for poking at opponents. The button also allows for OS with limb throws and has enough time for anti-airing if whiffed.

However, this move does not deal significant damage, so it's essential to look for drive rush checks using back medium kick and crouching hard punch.

**Dawson Throw Loop**

Doulam has a throw loop in the corner. To initiate the loop, throw an opponent into the corner, then perform a last slide. You can then throw again or opt for different combinations based on the opponent's reaction.

**Drive Rush Checks**

When opponents are closing space and attempting to drive rush or dash up, consider driving forward yourself. This allows you to mix up your attacks and catch opponents off guard, as they tend to prioritize not getting hit over other considerations.

**Back Hard Kick Anti-Air**

The back hard kick anti-air is an elite option for Doulam players. It's low-key the best anti-air in the game, making it effective against sim plays that rely on back medium punch and subsequent jumping.

This move can be canceled into a flame or other attacks, resetting the opponent to the air and discouraging them from jumping in again.

**Confirming Lights into Super**

It's crucial to learn how to confirm your lights into super with Doulam. This allows you to cancel your combos into level one super, avoiding burnout and improving meter management.

This skill is essential for approaching opponents and catching them off guard, particularly when attempting to catch them walking back or using drill kicks.
