**Street Fighter 6: Ken Approach**

As a player, I've been focusing on building muscle memory and awareness with Ken. In this video, I'll share some key tips and approaches to help you improve your gameplay.

**Fireballs**

When playing at a specific range, I like to throw different speeds of fireballs. This creates a mix-up opportunity where the opponent may jump forward or try to punish my run. From here, I can follow up with step kicks or overheads.

**Step Kicks**

The step kick is a reliable option for converting hits into specials. It's fully hit-confirmable and has a large confirmation window. When used in conjunction with drive cancels, it allows for good damage without spending meter.

**Drive Cancels**

When canceling into drive, I prefer to focus on finding punish opportunities rather than committing to drivers. This approach helps me conserve meter while still dealing significant damage.

**Neutral Game**

In neutral situations, I like to test opponents with button sequences like medium kitchen right. This can naturally combo into low follow-ups and even frame traps. Recognizing the opponent's response allows me to adapt my strategy.

**Punish Counter**

For punish counters, I focus on using drive cancels to minimize meter spent. For example, crouching heavy punch followed by a run and DP is a reliable option. This approach helps me deal damage without sacrificing too much meter.

**Old Key Mixes**

One of Ken's strongest mix-ups in the corner involves baiting throws with chinbuster or punch target combo into heavy kick gym right. Delaying the overhead follow-up allows for a meaty hit that links into stand meeting punch.

**Combos and Routes**

Here are some key combos and routes I use:

* Level 3 route: Crouching heavy punch into medium kitchen right, heavy gym right
* Drive Rush cancel spin combo
* Oldie gym roots foreign combo
* Grounded gym right scenario with a follow-up cancel to level 3

By simplifying my approach and focusing on building muscle memory, I've been able to improve my gameplay with Ken. I hope these tips help you as well.
