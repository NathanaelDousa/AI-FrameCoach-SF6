Jamie's Basic Tools and Pressure Strategies

This guide covers Jamie's fundamental tools at every range, including his anti-air capabilities. To create pressure, use anti-airs such as crouching Fierce, light kick Arrow kick, hard kick Arrow kick, and tensei kick. The tensei kick allows for jump canceling into medium punch, hard kick, dive kick, and provides pressure with a crouch and medium punch.

Jamie's Neutral Tools and Best Buttons

For winning games, use Jamie's best buttons: standing meeting kick, crouching meeting kick, standing hard kick, and crouching hard kick. These moves can be used for traps, punishes, and pressure. For example, one move led to a meaty opportunity where you can do stand medium punch, which is plus, and then get another drink opportunity on the counter hit.

Drinks and Damage

Drinks are essential for increasing damage output. Level 1 drinks provide more damage, especially with special moves, such as the OD Arrow kick, which sees an increase of up to 300%. Drinks also offer more situations, like a guaranteed mixup in the corner.

Break Dance Move and Command Grab

At level 2, Jamie gains the break dance move (quarter Circle forward + light kick), allowing for medium attacks on the opponent's wake-up. If they don't block, you can punish them with another attack.

Level 3 and Level 4 Moves

Level 3 provides access to command grab, an easy target combo, and punisher. At level 4, Jamie gains access to double pal (only available in level 4 into CA).

Increasing Drink Levels

To increase drink levels safely and easily, space out opponents like in the freeze frame shown here. Look for wake-up punishes to get quick drink combos. If you're feeling lucky, press parry and land a hard kick to go straight into double drinks.

Defensive Strategies

When opponents challenge you, use D medium punch for counter hits, leading to sweeps, drinks, and winning scenarios. When they jump back in the corner, Jamie has answers with his classic DP. If they block, get them with a wall bounce in the corner into palm, followed by a combo of your choice.

Advanced Combos

For advanced combos, practice delaying stand light kick to juggle with st Fierce into crouching hard kick. This leads to more pressure and drinks. If you don't have super, use stand Hard Punch for a perfect meaty to throw the opponent after.
