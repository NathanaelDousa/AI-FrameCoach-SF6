**Zangiefs overview**

As we dive into Zang's gameplay, we'll explore his strengths and weaknesses, optimal combos, and punishing strategies. With 11,000 health points, Zang can take more risks defensively than average characters.

**Basic Combos**

To start, let's look at some basic combos:

1. **Crouching Light Kick x3 + Forward Heavy Punch**: This combo is a great starting point for beginners.
2. **Standing Light Kick -> Driver's Crouching Light Kick -> Forward Heavy Punch**: This combo adds more complexity and damage.

**Punishing Strategies**

Now, let's discuss ways to punish your opponent:

1. **Crouching Light Kick**: A simple, reactive tool to check drivers.
2. **Forward Heavy Punch**: An excellent option for dealing with drive impact.
3. **Level 2/3**: Use these options if there's less than a 4-frame gap between the block stun and drive impact.

**Defensive Mix-Ups**

To force a defensive mix-up, try:

1. **Perfect Parry**: A high-risk, high-reward option that requires precise timing.
2. **Jump Cancel SD**: A jump cancel special attack can turn the tables in your favor. (Check out my guide on how to execute jump cancel SDs!)

**Reversal Options**

When facing a reversal:

1. **Level 2/3**: Use these options if you have a good read on the opponent's movement.
2. **Splash**: A jumping light kick that can hit an opponent walking up for a throw.

**Rush Check**

To check drivers, use crouching light kick and be prepared to react without looking for drives.

**Tips and Tricks**

1. **Optimal Combos and Punishes**: Vary your combos and punishes depending on the patch you're playing.
2. **Burnout Management**: Keep an eye on your health points and adjust your playstyle accordingly.
