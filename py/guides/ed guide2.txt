Ed guide 

When playing Ed, it is essential to maintain space control. One effective strategy is to use his zoning capabilities to keep opponents at a distance. Additionally, Ed has an unblockable normal special move that can be performed by jumping forward and then executing the desired action.

Another key aspect of Ed's gameplay is his excellent driver's jab, which is both quick and has good range. This move, combined with the crouching jab, provides a solid starting point for players looking to create pressure.

The "Fireball into drive" combo is a reliable string that can be used to maintain an advantageous position. Another useful combination is the heavy punch-light flicker, which has a true blockstring and pushes the opponent back by six frames.

When facing opponents who rely heavily on reversal attacks, Ed's medium kick flicker can be used as a means of countering their attempts. This move also provides significant pushback, giving players ample opportunity to retaliate.

In general, Ed's offense is highly dependent on his blocked normals. His five-frame crouching leg kick has excellent range and can be used to catch opponents off guard. Additionally, his Blitz attack can be punished if blocked by the opponent, allowing for a quick counterattack.

Ed also possesses a powerful tar combo that can be executed from a safe distance. This move is particularly effective when used in conjunction with other normal specials and combos.

For players looking to learn multiple characters, it is essential to maintain consistent practice to avoid setbacks. Even top-level players may experience reduced performance after switching between characters, so it is crucial to prioritize practice and adaptability.
