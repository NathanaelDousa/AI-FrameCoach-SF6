Manon guide

Street Fighter 6 has been released, and I've been playing a lot of Manon recently. Here are some top tips for improving your gameplay with this character.

Metal medals are crucial to increasing damage output from throws. You can earn these by performing command grabs or hitting grabs. For example, my classic cross-up command grab usually works well.

Manon has several unique attacks and target combos. Two essential target combos are the medium punch, medium kick combo, which leaves your opponent at plus 2, and the heavy punch, heavy punch combo, which puts them at plus 3. These combinations can be used to set up command grabs or other mix-ups.

It's important to stand in Manon's sweet spot, which is around this range. From here, you can use neutral pokes like standing heavy punch, medium punch, and kick to manage the opponent's distance and buffer into combos or hit-grabs.

Manon's anti-air game is unique, with a quarter-circle forward kick serving as her basic anti-air. She also has OD kicks that can be used to build up metals. Additionally, back-heavy punch can be used as an anti-air, but it requires precise timing.

Abusing Drive Rush is another key strategy for Manon players. This move allows you to link into standing heavy punch target combos and maintain pressure on your opponent. Drive Rush can also be used to loop command grabs and create a strong mix-up game.

The drive system in Street Fighter 6 is incredibly powerful, and players should strive to master it to increase their metal medal earnings.

When playing Manon, it's essential to think about the long game. If you have a significant life lead, consider using your levels to set up a perfect carry or try to get your opponent to make a mistake that will give you an advantage.

In terms of supers, don't just focus on the level 3 super. Level 1 and 2 supers are also important tools in Manon's arsenal. For example, the level 1 super can be used to escape from the corner and create pressure.

Finally, make sure to check out the character guides and combo trials for Manon. These resources can help you learn how to play the character effectively and improve your skills quickly.
