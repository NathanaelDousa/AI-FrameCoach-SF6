Ed guide
**Introduction**

Hey there, fellow gamers! Welcome back to my channel. Today, we're going to dive into the world of Street Fighter 6 and explore the ins and outs of playing Ed, one of the most unique and exciting characters in the game.

**Ed's Fundamentals**

Before we get started with advanced techniques, let's cover some basic information about Ed. He's a fast-paced character with a focus on quick combos and mix-ups. His moveset is centered around his "Snatcher" special move, which can be used to grab opponents or create distance. Ed also has a powerful "Kill Rush" super move that can turn the tide of battle in an instant.

**Mid-Range Play**

Ed excels at mid-range combat, where he can use his quick pokes and mix-ups to keep opponents guessing. From this range, Ed can effectively use his "Tether" mechanic to pull opponents towards him or create distance. The key is to master the timing of when to backstep and when to advance.

**Corner Mix-Ups**

In the corner, Ed becomes a nightmare to deal with. His Looping attacks and Tether mix-ups make it difficult for opponents to escape. We'll go over some strategies for setting up traps and taking advantage of Ed's corner game.

**Pressure and Punishment**

Ed is all about pressure and punishment. He excels at creating a wall of projectiles and then following up with quick combos. Opponents must be careful not to get caught in the mix, or they risk taking significant damage.

**Meterless Kill Rush**

One of Ed's most unique features is his "Kill Rush" super move, which can be used meterlessly if set up correctly. This means that opponents who are knocked down and unable to recover in time will take a full combo, making it difficult for them to escape.
