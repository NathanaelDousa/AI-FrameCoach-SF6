Kimberly is a fast-moving character with strong mix-up potential. While she can struggle in wake-up situations, her offense makes up for it. Let's discuss her top five moves in neutral.

Firstly, standing medium kick is her best button. It has decent range, is special cancelable, and drivew cancelable, making it a versatile move.

Next, low forward is a plus one block move that can be used as a low poke. While it doesn't have Drive Rush or special cancel options, it's still a good move for beginners to use.

Standing heavy kick is another strong button, with a plus two on-block frame advantage. It can be used to fish for trades or counter hits.

Crouching heavy punch is an excellent move that can be used defensively and offensively. It has a wide range and can be used as an anti-air button, making it a valuable addition to Kimberly's toolkit.

Finally, Drive Rush is a key mechanic in Kimberly's game plan. When used on block, crouching heavy punch becomes plus two, opening up strike throw pressure opportunities.

In terms of combos, Kimberly has some fundamental moves that can be used as mixups. Her B&B combos are centered around light confirms, which can lead to various options such as elbow or tattoo attacks. Target combo and crouching medium punch are key components of her mid-gameplan.

Some additional tips for beginners:

* Use standing light kick in neutral to create a mixup on block.
* Confirm with light shoulder and then use the resulting tick throw pressure to build space.
* Mainly use crouching heavy punch as your combo starter, as it does more damage than standing heavy punch.
* Be mindful of overheads and use them wisely.

Overall, Kimberly is a character that can be overwhelming at first, but once you grasp her fundamental moves and combos, she becomes a formidable opponent.
