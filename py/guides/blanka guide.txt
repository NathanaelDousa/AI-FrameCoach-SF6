Blanca is a high-risk, high-reward character who excels in mobility and trickiness. To utilize his tools effectively, understanding neutral play is crucial.

Neutral refers to the stage of the fight where neither player is blocking or getting hit by anything. Footsies, a term often used to describe this concept, refer to the battle for controlling the space in front of you, often using good pokes to get to a range you like while denying your opponent from achieving a similar range.

Neutral play involves three structures: passive, establishing, and preemptive. Passive play typically occurs at slower reactive paces, shut down by reacting to the opponent's options. Establishing play involves making a move to gain an advantage, forcing the opponent to respond. Preemptive play aims to shut down perceived assumptions or established plays.

Blanca's neutral play revolves around understanding his range and setting up different plays based on the scenario or matchup. When playing passive, footsies become an option, positioning oneself within Crouch medium punch range to outside of Crouch heavy punch range.

As Blanca establishes, he uses Drive Rush, a tool that can be used to overwhelm opponents. He also employs special moves like Blanca ball, Rainbow Ball, surprise hop, Amazon River Run, and wild Hunt to test the opponent's defensive tendencies.

Blanca's preemptive play depends on the matchup and scenario, including jumping or sliding under fireballs, establishing air approaches, or shutting down potential momentum shifts during sequences. Understanding variables and adapting to situations is crucial in neutral play.

The concept of neutral involves understanding RPS elements (rock-paper-scissors) and adapting to the situation. Blanca's high-risk nature means he sometimes has to establish in ways that might seem passive, but it's essential not to be too predictable.

In summary, footsies are a part of neutral, but not all neutral play involves footsies. Neutral has RPS elements, and understanding what beats what is necessary. Results may vary depending on match variables.
