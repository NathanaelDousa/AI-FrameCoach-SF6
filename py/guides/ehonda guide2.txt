Honda's primary focus is on his headbutt and butt slam special moves, which are highly spammable. The headbutt move advances forward, covering a significant distance, and has negative -3 unblockable frames when blocked. However, it remains safe to continue pressing buttons while blocking this move, as the opponent will be incentivized to do something about it due to the rapid drain on their drive gauge.

The butt slam move is similar to the headbutt but can leave you with plus frames if blocked, allowing you to regain control of the distance between yourself and your opponent. This move also allows for directional control in the air, enabling you to steer it towards or away from the opponent depending on the situation.

Honda's main normals on the ground game involve spamming the headbutt and butt slam moves until the opponent dies if they are simply trying to run past them. If opponents block these moves and start clamoring up, the go-to move is a medium punch into a crash and light punch combo, which can be repeated multiple times.

In neutral, Honda's godlike move is his forward heavy kick, a low-hitting move that hits from a significant distance away and forces opponents to block it low. This move can be used to punish opponents who try to walk away from you after being hit by headbutts or butt slams.

Honda's combo starter is the heavy punch, which has less range than his forward heavy kick but catches opponents trying to press buttons foolishly. A common combo involves a stand medium punch followed by a forward heavy kick.

When facing an opponent who tries to DI (directional influence), Honda's basic combo is a heavy punch into a quarter-circle forward kick, with the option to cancel into level three. Another simple combo involves holding back and repeating heavy punch to headbutt.

For beginners, it is essential to master basic combos and understand how to manage charge. Keeping charge in mind during all instances of gameplay will help you build up your character's charge meter, allowing for more spammable moves and increased damage output.
