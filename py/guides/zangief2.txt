**Sangi's Defensive Nature**

Before we get started, it's essential to understand that Sangi is a defensive character. He excels at reacting to his opponent's moves rather than taking the initiative. This means you'll often find yourself waiting for your opponent to make a mistake before capitalizing on it.

* **Spine Buster**: A high-priority special move that can be used to punish opponents who are trying to jump in.
* **Super Level 2**: A moderate-priority super that can be used to mix up your opponent's defenses.

**Abusing Opponents**

One of Sangi's greatest strengths is his ability to abuse his opponents' mistakes. This means you'll often find yourself waiting for your opponent to whiff an attack or make a defensive mistake before capitalizing on it.

**Don't Get Too Aggressive**

While it's tempting to try and take the initiative, remember that Sangi is ultimately a defensive character. Avoid getting too aggressive and focus on reacting to your opponent's moves instead.
